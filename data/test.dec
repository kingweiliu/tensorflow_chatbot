Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
That's because it's such a nice one.
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
I was?
Then that's all you had to say.
You always been this selfish?
No...
Who?
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
I did.
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
What's normal?
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
You're welcome.
Why?
As in...
You did what?
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
It's just you.
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
It's just a party. Daddy.
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
You burn, you pine, you perish?
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
It's a lung cancer issue
Okay!  I wasn't sure
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
No, I ' m not.
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
Not at all
What do you think?
How much?
What?
Forget it.
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
Block E?
But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
I didn't have a choice.
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
You -- covered in my vomit.
I just need to lie down for awhile
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
You know what they say
I'm gettin' there
What are you doing here?
Unwelcome.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
How?
For. . . ?
Fallacy.
No what?
Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
What?
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
Good enough.
Just for now.
With the teeth of your zipper?
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
I know.
You don't usually ask.
They tried... but I didn't let them.
Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
I'm not bargaining!
... for a commoner?
Look out of that window.
Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
Passion is something one cannot control!
Damn God!
Colon!  Don't!
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
Give me absolution.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
You think I don't know that?
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
Then why?
What's your cut?  How much?
No.  No way.
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
Divorced.
Yes, I considered it.
So you were never a prostitute?
They're not gonna send you right back.
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
It was my decision, not his.
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
End my career?
But Chief?  Over this??
Yeah, right.
When?
A timer.
Nah, why should you?
You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
This has nothing to do with your fire.
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Hey.  I'm a professional.
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Alright?
Alright.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
You're ruthless.
Well, that's great.
See you later.  Good luck.
Jesus Christ.
My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
Get down on your knees.
I have five-hundred dollars.
Yes.
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
Okay.
Don't speak Russian!
Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
Shut up.
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Put the camera down, Oleg.
Sit down!
Cut!
Be quiet.  Watch.
No, I don't get that!
Surprise!  Surprise!
Ha. Ha.
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
I used an accelerant.
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
Oh yeah, why?
How long they been livin' here?
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
Right. Just a sec.
Okay, come on down.
Yes.
No. I never did, either.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
No.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
He's got a point.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
Yes, it is, Hal.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Thank you, Daddy.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
Well, where are all of you off to?
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Well, I'm glad about that.
Thank you very much, Hal.
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
How about chargin' the battery?
Great, just great.
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
You're done.  End of story.
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
There's nothin' to talk about.
Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
So do you...been a long day.
Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
When? How?
What's wrong with that?
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
That's the way I see it, too.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Yeah, one of my favorites.
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
Jack?  What was that?
Hi, it's me...
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
That's what I always say.
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
Can't complain.
Naw, right here's okay.
I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
This ain't a credit business.
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
You noticed...
So you do know her.
What kind of mission?
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
And then?
Yes..thank God..
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
What is?
They are... with me...
Hey bud! Finger here.
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
...Leeloo.
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
This is a police control action..
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
Yeah, very big, a giant.
Got it...
He's on vacation.
What mission?
I've had enough good news for today
Three of us will never fit in there!
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
I'm so tired...
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
I love you...
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
Wonderful!
How much time is left?
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
No... not at all.  Where are you?
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
...I can't wait to be among you.
You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
Honey, I'm not, please...
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
Why the gun?
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
Don't...
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
Dino...
What can I do for you today?
Machine.
Right here.
Where are the women?
How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
Move it, dirtbag... !
Leave him alone.
Call me Tom.
I'm not so sure about this.
I know what you did.
One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
I told you, I don't know.
What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
Yeah.
What the fuck do you want from me?
Why?
What did you do with her body?
Stop talking.
Show me where you buried her.
Don't think I won't.
Easy enough for you.
The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
Shut up.
Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
Fuck you.
You'll get it when we get there.
Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
Yeah... guess so.
I'll risk it.
Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
Max.
Sounds good, pops.
Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.
Snuff films.
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
Thank you.
I told you I can't, not yet.
I'm here.
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
No.
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
Okay.
We're all like that.
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?
That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
None too discreet, is he?
He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
I don't want to.
What's wrong?
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
That obvious, huh?
Is there something we can do?
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
Then what else can we do?
It's okay, we're just about there.
Earth to Alice...
Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.
About Freddy?
You just stay put.  You need rest.
And ours.  It's our grandchild.
Been having bad dreams.
She doesn't want me around
My friend, with the funny hand.
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
No, the Dan part was nice...
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.
That's the only reason you're alive...
Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
No shit.
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
Makes you look like a nun--
He invited me to his house last night.
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
But if they <u>do</u>?
Huh?
I guess.
So?
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
The sound again?
Somewhere down there?
I'm with <u>you!</u>
I...don't know!
Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
What about time...?
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
Who with?
Huh?
Take a look.
Thirty-four seconds!
We can <u>ram</u> him!
- for horrors like yourself?
I am afraid not.  Therefore -
Obviously.
Thank you.
I'll be another!
Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
Twombley involved?
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
Yeah. I know about that.
I hear Twombley got shot.
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
Shit! What are we gonna do?
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
Oh.
Really.
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Piece of fucking cake.
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
What?
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
It's not that.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
No.
Nothing.
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
What are you sorry for?
Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
I'm not saying that.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
I'm fine, fine.
So?
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
Maybe.
Could be.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
Hi honey.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
Yeah.
I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
Jack doesn't need money.
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
How's that?
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
Jack?
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
Love! I'm made of love!
Everything you know is from me.
Bang!
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
What happened?
No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
No thanks. I don't drink.
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
Money.
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
A hunting accident is perfect.
Well, I never heard that one.
That's what you think.
I'm sure he's busy.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
Alice... I...
Stay cool.
Lemme take a look.
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
Because it is my duty.
Nine.
Where are we now?
The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.
A dubious distinction, no?
I know he left you behind.
Yes
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
Good. Good.
You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.
I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
Rose, I don't have time for this.
Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
Flying the plane.
White House Situation room.
We're under attack.
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
That's my job.
Yes, sir.
Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
A MiG? Where the hell are we?
Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
Commissioner, Aquarius.
Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
Dunn.
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
Who's that, Ted?
And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.
I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
No, I've been excited before.
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
Yes, sir.
Negative.
All right.  Here.
You're sure?
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
Sixteen 'C', why?
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
A hospital? What is it?
Certainly.
Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
I love you, Elaine.
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
And a little ice.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
You promise you'll write.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
I will, but Jim won't.
Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
Yes?
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
No. No thank you.
The cockpit? What is it?
Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
Lay off, asshole.
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
Yes.
Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
Uh, Matthew...
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
In the other man's rectum.
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
Nothing.
You must leave me alone on this.
... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
You understand that.  But how many others will?
You look very good.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
Sure.  Just a minute.
Ss'kya'ta'.
The human?
Yeah, I'll bet.
Talk to me, Hudson.
Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
What?
Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...
No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
It's insured.
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.
Are you finished?  You okay?
I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
Fuckin' A!
On my way.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Stand back.
No.  Have you?
Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
Uh, what's next?
Just get back here!
Seal the door.
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
Terrible.
No.. I've slept enough.
The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
You're really something, ace.
I'm sorry, Newt.
Did one of those things grow inside her?
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
Look!
Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
Perhaps.
You were sublime.
Extremely clever.
Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
Em iram! Em iram!
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
Ui-vol-i-tub!
Tell them to go!
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
He needs me, ma'am.
Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
Yes. He is a little strange.
You do me too much honour, Sire.
Ah-ha!
Your Highness.
Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
Yes, indeed.
Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
Twenty-six.
What is it?
Who told you this, Majesty?
Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
Ah, love again.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
Is she not here?
Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
How is your financial situation?
They say you're in debt.
How many pupils do you have?
How many?
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
It's a secret.
It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!
Mine?
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
Animals?
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
Oh, Excellency, would you?
Who are you?
Are you neglecting my request?
I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
This is only a vaudeville.
I'm too young to be so sick.
No! No, it's him!
Finish what?
Of course.
Also identical?
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
What for?
But, Your Majesty -
Because His Majesty wishes it.
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
Ah - you've heard that?
And do they believe it?
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
About the ballet.
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Yes, in the third act.
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
What? Who the devil are you?
What do you mean - now?
Who is she?
Show her in. Then go to bed.
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
Of course.
Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
Dr. Hirsch?
Yes, Doctor?
He said 'Jack'.
What happened to them?
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
Has his friend appeared to him again?
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
He's fine. We'll come right over.
Yes?
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Not just a patient -- me.
Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
I'll let you know the next full moon.
Charming.
Do me an enormous favor?
Werewolves simply do not exist.
Okay.
What?
No.
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
Why on earth do you say that?
Has he been refusing food?
No, but we're about to.
Do you have bad dreams, too?
So they said.
Did you see Jack?
David.
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
Shall we?
Nice to see you.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
Walk away, Jack.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
This is too much. I can't handle this.
I can't stand it.
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
What?!
Stop it, Jack.
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
Yes.
David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
What about the zoo?
Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
No.
And what, Sergeant?
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
Yeah.
Here's twenty-five thousand.
Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
Yeah.
Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.
Take it easy, Clark.
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
You understand?
I haven't got it.
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Don't you know?
I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
Yes, sir.
Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson.
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
Hello, darling.
Well . . .
Tomorrow night?
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
Yes, sir.
Where is he now?
Yes, sir.
Yes?
I haven't any.
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  Not a bad thought, eh?
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
All right. That's all.  Please, Matt.
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they
Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
He says he can't get away in the daytime.
What'll we do?
I hate to do this, but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing yet.
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
Come here, honey!
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
Yeah.
All right, dear.
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.
Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!
He was here?
Yes, sir.
It couldn't have been earlier?
You stay out of this, Bob.
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
What?
Swear.
You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!
Nope.
... Will Perry ...
Tomorrow.
Best damn plan I heard all war.
One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
What?
I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
You're not scared, are you?
What is wrong with you?
So what do we do, General Lee?
Sure, cousin.
Then let me run the show, General Lee.
You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin.  Cole Younger's going to make everybody rich!
Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
Which one, right or left?
Sadie was not a man!
Strategically.
They gonna rush us?
Of course!  Uh, sir?
All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...
You're right, sir.
My little Web did that?
Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck.
So we got a plan?
You're doing just fine.
What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
What do you think?
Don't care.
Bob's upset.
It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.
A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?
Oh yeah.
No, I --
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
Mmmm.
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
No! I mean, of course not. No.
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
Frank and me have to go away for a while.
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.
You are a hell of a woman.
Pity.
I'm not hanged yet.
Thanks.
No.
I think so.
You do that.
Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
I just though you were awful cute.
I'm doing you folks a favor --
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
Vengeance.
Stop it. I'm...
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
Pumpkin?
Is that Donald Trump's car?
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
Is it a what?
You just haven't been looking.
Do...what.
No-I can't take the time off work.
I don't want to talk about it.
Hi. Pat Bateman.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
Oh God, I can't believe this.
I know her. I knew her.
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
I won't...don't worry.
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
It's just not.
Lucky, I guess.
Uh huh.
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
Where are you going?
Patrick?
It looks that way, doesn't it?
Maybe it's just the light.
See you then.
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
Yes, sir.
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty.
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?
Hmmmm.
Jean? Hello? Jean?
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.
That's...that's too bad.
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
You're at Paul Owen s.
No.
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Well...
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
No. Not really.
No, he just hung out there.
I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
But...has anyone seen him in London?
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
Eerie. Really eerie.
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
Wait. That's not what I've got.
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
Not a big music fan, eh?
Where was Marcus?
Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
Al.
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
It's...it's...all right.
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
I can paint anywhere.
Then you've gotta ask him about that.
No way. You have this -- destiny.
Teddy was killed last night.
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
Nothing.
Guilt?
Poor baby. You know that's not true.
...Different?
Look at me! I'm gonna change.
Great.
You're just afraid to eat it.
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
What'd they ever do for you?
He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
Oh hi.
He's pretty tight with his family.
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
The wrong place?
I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.
I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
We'll come up with the next big thing.
Keep looking.
They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
No. Please.
Why's that?
She saved my life.
The Day Care?
Hmm?
They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.
There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
Before they kill somebody else, too.
Gary.
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
But you said the other --
Wait a second. He knows I know.
What?!
Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
I could get it out of him.
If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
Yes?
Right away, Exposition.
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
What's the other?
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
That's not your mother, that's a man!
Austin, I have something for you as well.
Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
Yes Basil?
Good on ya, man.
No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
Excuse me?
Sure.
Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
I couldn't have another bite.
I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
I am not.
Only sailors use condoms, man.
You know who.
Not now, Austin.
We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--
Are you crazy?
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
That's not mine.
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.
Where did you learn to shoot?
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
Right. Okay. Moving on.
Dr. Evil?
Sea bass.
Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser."  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer." Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.
I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
Seriously?
... power ...
So I'm still ...
Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...
Have we met?
Promised? Who promised?
We have met ...
Hmmm ...
Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
So am I.
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
Ring?
Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
1922. Why the kippers?
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
Yes indeed. I need protection.
Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
For a man in my position --
I meant me.
June, July ... August?
You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
You mean my other self ...
Very good, Steed ...
Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
Barely.
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
Nothing personal.
No trouble.
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
Have a look at this.
But --
What kept you?
Have you any place in mind?
Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
Decontamination -- ?
I see.
Well, I can't possibly go like this.
... and now?
I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
Anyone particular in mind?
No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.
You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
Where?
I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
Both, actually.
Walk over to the window ...
You wish.
Debbie's marrying Rick.
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
Hey, man, congratulations!
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
The best.
1002.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
I'm going now, Cole.
You're going to have a bachelor party?
Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
You better not have too much joy.
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
I am committed. I love you.
You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
I know what I'm doing... Go!
You know your father enjoys his company.
I hope those guys are all right.
Any time, Al.
What are you...
Let's have a toast.
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
Yes.
That's it.
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
You can tell a man by his friends.
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
This isn't right.
My gift to you.
Take care.
Who's your friend?
You got it.
Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
No.  I need a drink.
Yeah...
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
-- I told you to stay next to me!
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
-- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...
Everybody did.
I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
How's it going?
Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
Then why did you quit?
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
-- I work for the city.
I quit two days ago, Brian.
Who's doing this?
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...
-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.
And the putty around the door?
Yeah.
No need to be modest, Brian.
What the hell are we waiting for?
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
Coffee sucked.
I'm busy.
He's got piano lessons.
He's going to be a fireman.
Okay.
He's out.
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
What do you listen to, Stephen?
I might.
I need that report, Lt.
Investigator Rimgale.
Why?
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
Me?
Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!
You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
How 'bout...
Yeah!
YEAH!
Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is...
I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
She's also moorish.
Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
Manray needs a job.
How much?
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
And I'm the feet.
Well do something about it.
That's right.  Money turns the wheel.
Why?
How you sound?
Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?
I'm sorry I'm late.
I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.
I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
I'm wid it.
Go on.  Good so far.
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.
Who are the other characters?
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.
Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.
The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
Daddy, she's younger than me.
The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?
Do you know how you will use him?
Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.
The pleasure is mine.
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
He's just playing big brother.
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.
Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
Yeah.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
My name is Manray, goddamnit.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
I can't go all the way down south.
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
Not at all?
If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing.
This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
You've never had any formal training, either?
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
...no, she didn't...
...too early...
...too late, maybe around...
Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
A song a comin' I feel.
Enough.
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
No, before my time.
My people love me.
We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
It must have been some other gate.
We must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married to "Brown Bess."
Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
I will let down the steps for your honor.
Yes, sir.
No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
Certain?
Have you not a man whom you value?
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
Is he all right, papa?
Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
Would you have me spend my life all alone?
The milkmaid's daughter?
I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
And he doesn't care about me?
It's ten thirty in the morning.
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.
Who?
I'm -- I'm sorry...
None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
Can anybody hear me!
What do you mean, alone?
I asked for a policeman.
He's lying.
I didn't shoot West --
Yeah --
But not Pike's.
Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
Sir, yes, sir!
Your weapons, Sergeant.
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
Why?
I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place. It's gettin' bad out there --  Where's West?
You hated West more than any of us.
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
They?
But not the only victim, right?
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
Well?
Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
Well, he's a good soldier.
He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
Does Osborne agree?
I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
You and the Colonel go back.
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.
See, Ray, this is what we call "good cop, bad cop". She shouts, I stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established.
So noted.
Got it.
Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.
Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
You couldn't have known --
You wanted to get the truth.
Right back where we started.
Isn't this how your story goes?
Seven.
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
What, "The Truth"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem.
He whispered it in my ear.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
Childs.
What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --
Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --
We're not going anywhere.
-- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
Then it's unofficial.
We know.
Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
Yes!
Who is she? Where does she live?
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
I don't expect to.
Fine, I'm doing it.
I brought it.
Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
Thirty years. Maybe more.
Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
Eighteen.
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
I can get it. I can just...
Can I take your picture?
Oh, so this is a tall tale?
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
Am I?
Really.
So how does it happen?
What did he say?
I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
Story of my life.
They're your favorite flower.
I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.
I have the rest of my life to find out.
Go out with me.
There is no softer ground than town.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
Hello.
This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
That's because most of it never happened.
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
Of course.
But I understand you, Mom. I always have.
Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
Yes. Thank you.
Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
Good. 
Uh. Do you like England?
"I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
No. It's not that.
You can stay tonight.
I'm so sorry.
Yes.
Syevodnya
Yes I know.
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
So you're just going to be vindictive
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
You don't want to talk about it.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
You...
Get out.
Thank Christ for that.
No.
She's dead.
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
No. I think I better just go.
Goodbye.
Maybe you will find out.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
Cash.
Just wanted to see.
Yeah, I know.
Yes?
Oh, she older than that.
You didn't have to do this.
At church?
Can I come in?
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
Yeah. Transmission's shot.
You gonna miss your bus.
You been home yet?
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
Stop what?
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.
Rose... please...
Let go...
Let go of my arm...
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
You sayin' you'll do what?
BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
Come on, gal...
Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
Why you got me chained?
Get this Goddamn thing off me!
I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
Let go of me...
We drinkin' buddies now?
Maybe I won't.
You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was.
What'chu sayin'?
Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
I didn't start this, R.L.
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other.
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.  I think folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that.
Are you wasted?
Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.
Yeah, I do.
Ronnie. Please, baby...
I just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests.  Your money ticket get shipped today?
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
-- I should tear your head off.
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
Maybe we should do something?
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
Where is the subway station, please.
No.
Go to sleep, Charlie.
I didn't know.
Hey, when in Rome --
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
What'd she say?
I wasn't expecting you.
Give us a break...
Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
There she is!
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
It's done.  You don't have to come.
No.
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
I couldn't tell.
A wife.  She left.
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
Where's Ich?
Why would you care?
I'm amused.
Why me?
I planned on catching him, Captain.
You're foreigners.
I have to get to Sugai.
I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
You want him dead too.
Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.
Death.
Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are made to last -- as least they were. But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last.
I am?
Also extraordinary things.
You're just all so... so different.
Thank you.
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.
If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  I got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  Good luck.
Yeah.
Day after tomorrow.
I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  A direct hit is a positive retirement.
I know all that.
Nexus designated Mary:  incept November 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position.
Prosit.
I'm doing okay.
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.
No rust?
Huh huh.
Never been more sure of anything in my life.
Yes?
Of course.
Do you recognize any of them?
Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
It would be my child.
Can you?  I couldn't.
There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
Hmmm?
You mean a woman?
Because it's not.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
What difference will it make?
What's up?
No.
One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
Don't move.
Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as you can.
But how come I'd be there?
Of course.
You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.
I don't have one.
They left.
We sure did.
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
How do you do?
I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
What?!
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
I just had a mental picture of...
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
Rogers Hornsby?!?
Oh, I could die...
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
No.
Why doesn't it never work out?
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
Doing what?
I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
They like Dr. Pepper.
Sorry.
Sure.
Two weeks.
The engine is still running.
Sorry!
You said it would be easy!
I like it.
He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
Wow.
That's boring!
It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!
Okay!
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
Maybe. But that's how it works.
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
But, Eve, I would--
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
Thanks.
Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
My mother's like that.
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
Yes, sir.
No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
No. Sit down.
Your mom made that all by herself.
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
Yes, father?! Yes?
I promise. Is that all?
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
Russia.
Yeah.
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
True.
So, did you buy a movie?
Bye, Adam!
Up there!!
Just look!!
You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
Well, we're here to help!
Yes, ma'am.
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
No.
Coming!
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
Yeah. Let's dig in!
Just open the door.
Mutants?!
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
Well, I am the head of this household--
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
I think...it...works.
No.
He's from Alaska.
Always good advice.
Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
Uh..he might of.
Yes, you do.
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
I know...I know. You did the right thing.
What?!
Come on.
Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.
You bet, Mom! Coming up!
No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. Let Tits see her kid.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
Okay.
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Jeffrey nothing.
I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
Then you got undressed.
Yes.
See my nipples?
You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.
Do you know?
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Yeah, hurry up though.
That's not crazy. I like you too.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
Don? Are you in with them?
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Please, please stay.
I sure don't hate you.
That's good.
What do you want?
What if Frank came over here and found us?
Do you love me?
Sometimes I think I do.
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
Who, Dorothy?
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Mommy's here.
If you want to.
A ride? Hell, that's a good idea. Okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
Okay Frank.
There ya go.
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
Yeah.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
That sounds great!
Uh-uh.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Maybe so.
I don't know. He moved away.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Yeah.
Actually. I've been in twice.
I'm really sorry.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.
What is it?
Let's wait for some slow one.
No.
Dorothy Vallens?
Go ahead.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
Go find one.
Aye.
Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.
Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.
Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.
Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
What?  What, that guy?
You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.
Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.
Right.
Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.
Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
German.  Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.
...so that which is good may flourish
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
We'll find it. Just calm down.
Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
It is your corrupt we claim.
Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
Of course they were. How many?
The fat man.
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
The Sicilians.
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
Why was I not informed of this?
Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
Sweet-n-low!
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
Eight.
It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men  Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?!  They sure as fuck did!
Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
Hey, Murph.
You sure you killed them?
Y'know it is, a bit.
Well, what'ya do?
What the fuck do you mean?
Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
Thank you, Father, thank you.  Whatever. Goodbye, amen.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me half to death."
I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Right. The blond guy.
She's an attractive older woman.
Yeah.
No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
You're right. You're right.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
As long as he gets out OK.
Bob?
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
What?
Shh.
You don't know how to hotwire.
How much?
She needed it.
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
Shut up!
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
Who's Mr. Henry?
I'm sorry, Bob.
I did.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
He was all right.
Check the fucking elevator. It's moving.
Yeah.
I'm not kidding.
Pretty much everything.
What do you mean?
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
Behind Bob's house.
We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
How?
Nice to meet you.
Thanks.
Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
Yes, he did.
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
I want to ask a favor, boys. One day, when I'm long gone and all but forgotten, make one last toast to Abe Henry. And remember me as a friend.
Move.
And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
It was stupid.
Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
Cuba.
Uh-uh.
Abdul-Shabazz?
The front stairs.
Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac.
What are you talking about, Bob?
You're paranoid, Bob.
I can't believe you said that.
He electrocuted someone?
That's too bad.
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
No. I was calm.
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
There were more than that.
We'll have to see when we get back.
Come on, Dignan.
Watch me.
I can't do that, Bob.
I didn't have any choice.
I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
Now!
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
He said what?
I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
He's damn good.
We're just going over a few things.
Who? Applejack?
In the cash register. Step away from the door.
Got a little lucky.
It's locked.
What?
Do you know what his budget was?
We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?
Did he say anything to you?
I speak English.
Yes...
You're a liar.
I can't let you do that either.
No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
Felt a little light.
-- my coat -- but we should --
-- take the back -- get another car --
Conklin up front.
No. There's nothing new.
-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
I worry when you get like this.
I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
I should be better by now.
But it ends up the same.
We can't wait to be sure.
What?
Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
What do you mean?
I want to come in.
I want someone I know to take me in.
Sounds like a threat.
-- uplink all relevant files to Kim --  -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone --
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
Who's this?
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
Before this? Before Bourne? No.
You mean, did I want a date?
And why is that?
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
I don't want to leave.
He has already agreed to come.
I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
You fancy him.
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.
With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.
No. He did not.
Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.
This night is too beautiful to have again.
It's battle I want, not talk.
I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.
What is it?
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
And the bad news?
Great. I'll see you soon.
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
What? What could he do?
How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?
Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
Where are my goddamn books?
I thought you were a December baby.
That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.
All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
I'm sorry.
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
What do you want to know, Evan?
It was a long time ago.
Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
What do you mean?
Like how?
I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.
I get it. You can drop it now.
Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
I come from a big family.
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
Oh my God oh my God...
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
My husband is with me, too.
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
Oh, yes.
-- Will he keep his word?
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
Well?
Yes, Monsieur.
How long can I afford to stay closed?
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
Er, my check, please.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
I'll tell him when he comes in.
I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.
It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
Has it got a wow finish?
Yes.
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
No.
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
All except one. He won't have you.
Everything is quite all right.
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
And I said I would never leave you.
She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Yes, ma'am.
Won't you join us?
Goodnight.
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
I love you very much, my dear.
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
Are you quite finished with us?
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more "persuasive methods" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now.
Thank you.
Mademoiselle.
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
But I have no excuse to close it.
Ask Monsieur Rick.
Why? What's in Lisbon?
Our entertainment is enough.
Victor Laszlo?
His escape.
Why two?
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.
Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.
Put that gun down.
Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
There seems to be no secret about that.
In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.
Well, what makes you think I haven't?
-- You thought what?
I like it fine here.
Good. Then have a drink.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Just a little something of my own.
No, I don't.
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
Do too much, I'll die.
Going to die anyway.
Survive today, that's the point.
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
You are.
Look again, asshole.  It's a mirage.
Well, I do a little drawing --
Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?
What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
Not if you work for FedEx.
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
You want to.
No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --
That's my sea anchor.  My second one. Made it out of part of the sail.  It keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  In theory.  And this, this I used to collect water. About half a cup a day.
Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
You too.
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road.
Let's eat.
Can you find her?
What's going on down there?
Borrowed.  I borrowed it.
The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx, that's women, that's life.
We're on.
Want to see my raft?
I braided them.
Forty-three days.
To Wilson.
Deep, real deep.
Permission granted.
It claims to restore monthly regularity.
We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here?
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.
Good night, Daddy.
She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
Fine. That's all there is to it then.
We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places...
Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
His father's dead, right?
Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
What about the trees?
Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there.
Is it true?
Okay. Then you can be of use.
That's 'cause I sticked my *own* knife in the wound--after she go, I sticked my *own* knife in there. I poked it all around, I just tryin' to find the same place she got me.
All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a *sailor*!
How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
Of course.
You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
Right.
Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
It's just my heart.
No trouble.
Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
Mind your own business, Peaches.
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today.
That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right?
That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.
He ain't never been outta Maine!
On me. For the seat. Cheers.
You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.
Two million.
Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
It's Alfonse. I want to settle up. I haven't been ducking you. I told you I'd get it.
Just the last three weeks.
And these cops? What do they get?
I was doing it for them.
Guess so.
I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."
Mob?
We sure Big Al threw him to us?
Well, this is just fucking great...
So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says "The code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!
You sure?
And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
Eight A.M. flight.
What do I always tell you guys? Don't spend it all. Sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. Save some. Put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. That's it. The gig's up.
That's it.
I have a good crew.
You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
I need you to stake me.
You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you?
No thanks. I'm good.
I think I just broke my hand.
All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
Sure.
LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
Help me.
You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me.
Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
I'll worry about Customs.
Don't worry about it.
Why?
Uh-huh.
Lighten up.
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
Glenn talked you out of it.
What about what?
You sold me out. You should have trusted me like I trusted you. You fucked up. You fucked up HUGE.
Good point.
We never had a problem with that before.
No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker.
But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!
With identification.
No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-
Eee Oott Auught!
HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!
You are Officer Richard Rottovich. And this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski. I'm looking for Jake Vig.
That's it?
It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.
That's what I'm talking about.
Jack Manfred.
A couple I know are getting married.
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
I'm working on that soccer story.
I'll try and make it.
Who was he?
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
I. sold the car.
How did you land that?
Fine.
-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
Leave it.
I hope it brings you luck.
It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong.
Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
It's not that.
Your father?
That's fine.
What kind of trouble?
Who's they?
And I thought you were a bright woman.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
I told you, all bets are off.
Yes.
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Have I?
Too much. Eighteen hundred.
How long have you worked at the casino?
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.
That bitch? No.
Don't worry.
Do you have a Salon Prive?
Any exceptions?
I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.
Fine.
Fine.
I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
What flickering light?
I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
Well, there's the possibility of...
I read the same here.
-- open quantum latches --
Energy shielding positive function.
No.
I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
Right!
Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
To explode, of course.
Of course not.
...nine seconds...
-- Remark.
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.
Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
Yeah?
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
Well, what you might try is --
Talk to the bomb.
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
Bruno's girlfriend.
Sooo...whattya think?  Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date.  Play a little miniature golf or somethin'.
What're you talkin' about?
Justine was not an unwilling participant.
No time.
No way.
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
It's a rule.
I got overhead...
Yech...
Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go.
Hello...
We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
Lauren's not my wife.
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
Yeah...
So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
Yes on all counts.
You need to get out more.
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
Open it.
We're quoting Mom again.
You don't want to.
A friend of your fiance's.
Let go of my hand.
Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
I understand.
He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?
What guys do.  'Nother order.
I just don't go in with any expectations.
What?
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
Where?
Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
You get it when I get her.
Tell everybody hey.
Later.
Max--
I'm the victim here.
Hear me out.  This person I've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married--
I'm a toy to her.
She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
--a philandering pig.
Say the words, "I understand."
I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.
I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer.
It's okay.
I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
What? That's disgusting!
Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
Check!
Curly.
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
Tickets?
Nah. Couldn't be.
No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?
Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?
Hawk?
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
They're what?
What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?
Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
Let's lift up her shirt.
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not "Taxi Driver." Now listen up cause this next part is crucial. Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and...
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
Like a spear.
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
Donnie! Give it back!
What did you say?
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
I'm sorry.
Will you go with me?
No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
Why?
You want to kiss me...
Maybe she's asleep.
What's wrong with you?
Who's Frank?
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
The Lifeline is divided that way.
When did you stop taking your medication?
Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.
I know, Dad.
Why should we care?
Gretchen. We're going together now.
Yes.
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
No. That makes you keep searching.
I know.
The good stuff.
Yes.
I... I was playing with fire.
Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
Soon. Time is almost up.
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
Kitty...
But now you can't go.
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
Don't let that worry you, Annette!
No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
Really, Loretta?
My mom wanted me to have this?
Thank God for bunge cords.
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Here, have some.
Yah-sure, fine... fine.
Shut it up, Loretta.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
"Most smartest?" Oh, that's good, Loretta. Make sure you get a picture of that. "Most smartest." We're cuttin you off and sendin' you home.
I got a hairdo.
Okay. Take her purse.
What?
All right, then.
Oh yah-sure, I know what some of your big city, no bra wearin', hairy- legged women's libbers say, "Pageants are old-fashioned" and, uh, and "demeaning" to the girls --
"U.S.A. is A-okay."
Tammy Curry?
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
"Proud... to be... an... American."
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Uh, Gladys?
We need more bars!
Shut up, Hank. This here's business.
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
Tina! Tina!! TINA!!!
"My dear"...
I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
None of your business...  Take another letter.
I wanna powder my nose...
All right -
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
What do I get?
That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
I can't do it...
Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?
The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride. 
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
And Vera niece, too.
You worm!
No, that wasn't it...
I still like UPSTART the best.
You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack...  Now what were you saying?
You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.
Well, maybe I am a little headstrong...  But, you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me. 
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
I didn't come here to be insulted.
With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control -- 
I've always thought that myself.
If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?
Well, these things take time.
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
Did you see it?
He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
Right... Right.
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
No, more of an acquaintance.
Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?
...Yes, Sir.
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
And what was that, John?
I don't understand.
Well, yes.
No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
What a mess.
You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
You've never been?
That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
Good day, Mr. Merrick.
Say "Mmmerrick."
But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
Of course.
Yes, John?
I thought as much.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
John.... how can you ever forgive me?
Oh no, I couldn't.
No, he's very upset about something.
I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity.
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
There IS no one.
But, Father, it IS!
Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
What are what?
You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
"The fifth one this week"!
But, Erik...
I mean, you could have killed yourself.
Why?
Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...
Yes?
I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
The important thing is not to panic.
What?
What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me...
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
Find it... AND cross it!
I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
Don't you FEEL it?
Row! Row! Row!
Make your mind up.
Look out!
No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
Well, come on!
To the oars!
I've got you!
Oh... er... yes...
We'd be the first!
I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
Over the Edge of the World.
The Dragon...
What do we have to do?
He hasn't.
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...
No, it is NOT.
I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
What are you talking about?
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
What have you got there?
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
But it's a responsibility...
I must only let the red rage...
Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
Say hi to Naomi.
Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
Okay, I guess.
In the room?
I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
Why?
Well, I didn't want to assume.
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
I don't know what that means.
Probably see you at the book store.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
Yeah?
Wilmont. Near the high school.
It's okay. I didn't think you were.
Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
Very much.
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
Thanks.
No, not at all.
Okay.
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
When?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
I want to have a baby.
No, it isn't that.
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
Yeah, Tangerine?
No.
What do you mean?
I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
What?
Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --
Egad, were you horrified?
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
You had the whole human race pegged.
Hi.
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
I'm Joel.
Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
yeah?
I love her.
I think she's great.
Yeah.
Make love?
Says you were a bully...
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
I just walked in.
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
Hi.
There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
And what are you like? A wino?
I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
You have to stop this!
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
We'll speak soon.
Sorry. I just --
I know. Anyway --
You love him, don't you?
What?
Well, what should we do?
This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.
And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
Thanks, Stan.
Can I... I brought some --
They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
Welcome, Howard.
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
Maybe after the holidays then.
Then check the connections.
This one's history. Moving on...
She was unconscious, Patrick.
Jesus, Patrick!
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.
You bet your raggedy white ass I am.
As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then I embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace.
A job for me?
Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.
I don't know anything about it.
Justin?
Hold on, Coop...
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
What about the accumulator...?
We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
What?
I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!"
I don't know, the screens are dead...!
Hurry.
His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
We'll make it.
Oh God...
A power drain --
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
The dark inside me.
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
Starck!
Justin. I won't let you die.
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.
Alive?
Do it.
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible...  Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened...  The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead.
The Core...!
I don't know...
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
Don't... don't do this...
Do you know what a singularity is, Miller? Does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is?  It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal NOTHING. And if God is Everything, then I have seen the Devil.  It's a liberating experience.
NOOO!
What is that?
I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
We don't have time to fart.
What is it, Smith?
Come again, Skipper?
Justin?
Come around to three-three-four...
But you can breathe it.
Carbon dioxide?
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
Blow it up?
No. I'll be right back.
Wasn't that ship destroyed?
You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
There's no one here.
I did.
Keep him talking.
Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber...
All boards are green, everything's five by five.
The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this...
Get them back --
It wants me. I have to go.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
I like the sound of that.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
Deb, it's me. It's still me.
Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
Youthful high spirits.
I'm sure he's matured since then.
Should?
Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
That's terrible news...
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Not this again --
What about you?
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Ben, are you there?
Oh, it is.
I can go hotter!
Please tell me you go silent too.
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
And if he's not...?
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Never better.
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
That's what we're here to find out.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
What in the world would give me that idea?
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
You were?
Why didn't you say something?
You need a doctor.
What I should have done a long time ago. Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
Victor, are you feeling alright?
Just find him.
You want to work at Carl's?
Later.
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
Why?
They were left over from the last shift.
But they weren't mine.
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Ugh.
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
Dad says!
I know what I look like.
So are you.  Are you shaking?
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
All right, I take it back.
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
Really?
Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.
I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
I'm really pretty busy...
Damone! You come here?
No Damone. I don't understand.
What do you read? What's the last book you read?
Yes.
They're fuckin' with us.
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
Believe it.
There's nothing to it.
He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.
No.
I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
What do you want?
He's not coming.
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
What class?
Really?
I don't know. I guess so.
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
Aloha, Spicoli.
Sure thing.
I've heard that, too.
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
Yes... It makes sense.
Awake? What do you mean?
Not for me.
Righto!
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
WHAT?
Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
Naw! Not a major.
Really?
What?
One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
To do the job, of course. Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!
OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
Are you ready?
She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.
I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.
Yes!
We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it.
Never missed a plane yet.
Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?
No! I swear I'm not!
Of course, officer.
Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. I can't even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours.
I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.
Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
Yeah.
With what just happened upstairs --
We're lucky to be alive.
C'mon guys--
If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all.
Easy.
Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.
My truck.
Well...
No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
Huh?
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
Seven.
Oh? And what's that?
What the hell's going on here!?
What?
I'm fine! I'm fine!
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
HELLLPPP!
I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.
YOU'LL HIT US!
Stop her!
Let's lock off this room.
Oh...
Deal.
I think --
I'm not lying.
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
'Forgive'...? For What?
I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me.
Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
I'm not!
God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
Dick, we need some time apart --
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
All square, Doc.
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
But I'll never win that.
I didn't have much to do with it.
He's a socialist, then?
And you think it's worth all this?
Be careful, Francie.
Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.
Harry.
You looked okay.  Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
Yeah.
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass of myself.
Who said I was a lady?
That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.
Whattaya think you're in now?
I guess.
No. To thoroughbreds.
Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy.
Who?
Oh Harry...
Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
Why do you say that?
Just a little way.
What'd you do?
That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
Oh, Mama, don't you understand?
Smile, little sister, smile.
What's wrong?
Not long.
I'll be back.
Yes, Mama.
I have!
It ain't for lack of trying.
Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
Please sit down...
I see.
And what's that?
All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.
Yes. It was very good to see her.
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
Sedate her.
No!
No!
You're kidding.
Then why weep for him?
The music? Or the fire?
Worse.
People can be kinder than you think.
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
So have I
Nothing can. Not ever.
To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
All my life I've known.
Is that what makes it so delicious?
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
Only you.
Your decision. For us.
It is
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
This ice will break yet.  How's our guest?
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
Very well then.
As a march hare.
Somebody has to!
Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
I didn't find what I was looking for.
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
Why?
I'm... dying.
Madness?
Tomorrow is another day.
Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
I don't know.
Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?
I meant everything.
I can't, Barry...
Oh, you...
I need you so much, Claudette.
For sure.
Here we go.
Don't get up. Take a second...
I had to.
Wait, wait! When I was finding these goodies in the shed. I also found this letter which a camper never sent home. Listen.
Ned!
I call it my shower dream.
Mmmmmmmph.
Whassamatta?
Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
I got to.
They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
That's thirty percent.
Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.
Stop? We're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we?
If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will.
He's running the show.
Thank you, son.
To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
He's my son.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
Come again?
That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  Go sit over there.
In heaven.
Yes, she is.
No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
No, I didn't.
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
Pops, when you're right, you're right, and you are right.
Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club.
I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
Forever together.
In the Winnebago.
Yep.
You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.
It's a flop house.
No!
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.
Me too.
Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?
Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!
He signaled the Ranger.
I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, "Help us!"
No.
That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.
Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
What?
No, I didn't.
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
They broke when you fell.
It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
Where are you right now?
Where are you?
Yeah.
Okay, I'll have one.
That's what I hear.
I've been accused of that wish.
Don't say my name.
Standing right here in my office.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.  But I expect a certain amount of pain.
Same rules for everyone, sir.
Across the board, sir.
I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.
Sir?  What did he say?
Motherachrist...
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you?
Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing.  They'll never know whose leak it is.
Not that.  The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
I was one member of the investigating commission.
That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
In face, I do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.
I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?
Doesn't matter who she picks.  No woman is going to last one week in a commando training course.  And I don't care who it is.
I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am.
I'll work on it, ma'am.
'Snot me.  It's him.
Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO!
Sir?
I oughtta report you.
Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.
Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
I don't know, I don't care.
Well, now I feel so much better.
Mighta been civilian.
Smoke it!
You heard me.  Move on.
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
Should I be afraid?
That's not right.
Good to see you again, too, sir.
Your new roommate.
That your desk?  I'll take this one.
FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for?
You knew about us?
Women.
I don't know.  Seems...
Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
Great. See ya then.
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun...
Nearly four years...
Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
Yeah, well...
Sure. I'd like that.
Are you sure?
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
Really? I'd like to find out.
Speak of the devil.
He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
Nick Tatopoulos.
That's the problem. He did.
What's it to you?
Five bucks.
It's your choice.
More than that. I believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region.
I don't think so.
Allez, allez!
That is when we will go in.
Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!
They are with me!
Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
We know.
We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
We've met before.
So you're in?
Makes us look more American.
Good idea.
How do I do that?
I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.
It's okay. I know her.
It's Raymond.
Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
You go first! There's no time!
That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't.  I can't!
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
Dear God.... How did I come to this?
You could order something in.
It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
No I didn't.
He probably... Has some very important business to attend to...
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
What's  your name, son?
Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
Up.
Yes?
There is no weather in space.
Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...
Yeah, what is it?
All right, let's all settle down.  If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control.
BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!
No. Keep all energy to the armor.
We made it. Commander, we made it.'
On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
Jason..
JASON...
I don't think that's a cloud...
Why does this sound so familiar?
Yes. Yes, I'm here!
No I don't. But I know somebody who does.
I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!
That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.
Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.
You have ten seconds.
Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
No! I swear I don't know! Please!
Simpler.
This is embarrassing, really.   I shan't tell this story when I return home.
Home.
Thanks
It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
NO, Thank God he has not.
But there it is!...
But...Why?
Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!
Pedal to the metal...
Patience, Lt. . Patience.
The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
What does she see in them?
Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga...
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?
While they're strung out?
Same old story.
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
No.  I guess.
I ain't forgot about the freedom.
No, my lord.
I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I.  But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.
We better, Congress invented him.
Get the body of our army up to Greene's vanguard as fast as we can.  All the damned fool has to do is hit the British rearguard and then hold for us.
Colonel Hamilton.  Anyone who served under Arnold, I want them shipped north.  I don't want any troops here who served under Arnold.
Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?  Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!?  You realize what would happen if this fort fell?  The whole Hudson would be open to them!
I'm not sure.
George, we've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army.
As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient.
Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!
Joseph, are you afraid to cross that river with me?  I accept your resignation.  With regret.  You have leave to return to Philadelphia...
We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
My baby daughter has died... my baby... mon petite Henriette...
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
You're no fool, George.  You never have been.
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
And have you heard anything from our dear friend, Sally?  What with all the rumors getting back to England.  I thought she might inquire after us.  But then I believe she always looked down on us.
Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.
Yessir!
It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
Yes, but I've spent the last winter studying all the great battles of history.  And I read the lives of Caesar, Alexander, Hannibal...  Sir, I'm volunteering you the wholehearted support of the Rhode Island army.
Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.
What else should I become?  There's no difference between Virginia and England.  I must be educated if I'm to take my place in society.  My father couldn't afford to send me to England for school -- he made a shambles of our fortunes.  Everyone laughs at me.
Let's get you darker!
I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
Juba was a Numidian.
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
They all sound big at the talking stage.
I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
Not too bad.
No shit? What're some of 'em?
Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
That's right, me.
I'm with you on that. And don't you think it needs a good female part? Increase the romance angle.
What about her?
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know.
I'll find it.
Gimme an hour.
First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
Who is this?
What three hundred grand?
Who?
Never heard of him.
Or else use your fucking imagination.
Ray. Look at me.
That's correct. Look at me.
Yeah? Which terminal?
I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here.
Leo spanked a waitress?
Where you been, Harry?
I know what a marker is.
That's right. As a matter of fact...
They always paid.
Not really.
Maybe a few times I have.
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
Read it. It's a grabber.
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
I found him.
Personally?
What Get Away jet?
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
Ask your man here.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
With what? Wiseguy money?
What happened? The pressure got to you?
Martin, look at me.
Like this?
Buddy?
You broke in?
What if it was?
How much is the wife offered?
What're you doing here?
I want to know.
The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back.
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
You're as bad as Harry...
Couldn't find my toothbrush.
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
Pick 'n' Save.
Come on in.
Murray's dead.
Oh, yeah, sure.
What money?
'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.
I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.
Thanks.
And after all, you have such morals.
Arctic Warrior, passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea day two month two year one nine five three.  Over.
Roger that, North Island. Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Over and out.
Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?
We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
After fifty years there ain't nothin' left but shoe leather.
Maureen?
Or uninvited guests.
Maybe he isn't alone.
What?
Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
What is it?
How long to fix?
Turbine rotor's shot.
Hard to say.
She take a radio?
What, you think there's something funny about it?
Yeah, yeah.
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.
Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
What is it?
What do you propose?
With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
I don't know what you're talking about?
Right.
I bet you did.
Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.
Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.
Because of the gold.
Lights?
I feel fine.
Better than starving to death.
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.
They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
So what did happen?
Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
February first.
Wish I could say the same.
I don't know, are we?
Not our mystery guest again.
Maybe it was more than that.
We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
What do you say, Dodge?
How's that?
Moving to Sweden.
We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around.
And look what happened.
Shut up.
The mooring hasn't come taught.
Leave it.
Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
Who?
Not the Maxine?
God, how horrifying.
What is it now?
Nothing.
Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
I didn't check my messages...
You can count on me, sir!
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you.
In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
Then why do you hate me so much?
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
Why do you have that stupid poster?
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
Uh oh... don't turn around...
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
Or maybe not.
Okay, okay!
Can we call you "Weird Al"?
Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
I know... I still can't get over that his name was "Seymour."
Forget it, I can't explain it...
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
It's always closed...
JOSH!
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
Where?
He does that every single day.
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.
You're insane.
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
Nothing.
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
What time?
Actually, he's a really nice guy.
It just came yesterday...
Oh, hey Enid...  So... we finally made it!
Nothing.
Well, we won't keep you.
I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
That's okay...
Seymour does.
It's kind of falling apart.
I know it's over, asshole, I --
Norman.
You're late, asshole.
I did too!
Hey, where are you going?
Indian records?
I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign."
Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records...
So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
NO!!!
I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...
Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...
I'm not holding my breath in that department.
Jesus, Seymour.
Just wait here.
Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
Hooray for me.
What are you, a fry cook or something?
I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
Oh yeah?
It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
How can you be so sure?
It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know...
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
What about this?
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
They're Seymour's.
Maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy. Who knows? It could be a million things. It's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain, that's for sure.
I wish I could see him.
I am.
Right, exactly!
She's not at home?
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
That slut!
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
Starling?
Yes he is.
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.
In point of fact, it didn't.  But I'm convinced the theory is sound.
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young.
Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life. 
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
-true enough- but without the comedy relief. 
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
I can try.
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
Has it ever done that before?
Have you ever failed?
You think they'll come then?  Why?
Why?
Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge. 
I expect so- it's from my wife.
I have to ask- why do you need me?
Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men.
I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
We don't have a relationship.
How is he these days?
I won't.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
Okay, that's no problem.
Oscar!  You poor kid!
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
Thanks.
Oh, hello, Peter.
I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.
As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
Good-bye, Peter.
I don't know what to do anymore.
It was full of this awful pink ooze.
Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.
Finally came to your senses, huh?
Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out of time.  Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets.  Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...  ... Good night.
I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you?  The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too.
Ghostbusters.
Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.
I know.
Command me, lord.
-- the sorrow --
I await the word of Vigo.
You've got to stop them.  Please!
I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff.
No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
I knew that.
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.
Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
I'm Peter --
Okay, but you're missing all the fun.
We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall.  How about you, Winston?
I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.
Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.
Hi, Louis.
Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
It's in the stars.
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
All right.  What do you want to do?
I'll scream.
You heard it?
Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
I don't believe in luck.
Thank you.
The EPA?  What's he want?
Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind of thing all the time.
Are you Peter Venkman?
I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
In a storage facility.
Because you didn't say the magic word.
The magic word is "please."
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
Were you recently in the bathroom?
What do you mean "bad?"
Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
Looked at with your eyes.
Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
What do we do now?
You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when you're starting a new company.
Where are you, Pete?
It's not good, Pete.
Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
Why?  Then they'll notice when I'm gone.  Well.  I'm making a public appearance aren't I?
If I may be so bold...
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
Do you want posters, too?
That's difficult to say, general.
I'll nose around...
That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
You're hearing about somebody else.
When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
You don't know how wrong you are.
They can't... if this is Rome...
Yours will do!
He's like you, sir, too tough for the Gods to swallow.
What deal?
I can see that...
Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
Don't be ridiculous.
Make us rich, Proximo, make us very rich...
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
No.
No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
Of course not.
Yes.
Yes.
During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
I've never been to it.
Because it isn't true.
Then what?
Elaine -- that is not what happened.
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
No.
I don't understand.
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
I don't see how we can.
I have to go back now.
Why wouldn't it?
Carl who?
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
No, Benjamin.
Shhhh.
No.
Is the doctor anywhere?
Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
Who screamed?
You heard me. Out of here.
Because I don't like you.
I want you out of here.
Get out!
Could you bring it up?
The Singleman party, sir?
It's in the main ballroom.
What? No. Nothing.
Oh no.
When is he coming back?
Yes.
What?
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
It's all right.
Benjamin?
Will you unzip my dress?
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
What if he did?
Where is it?
Oh my God.
I've got to go.
Oh. Hello. Hello.
Waiter!
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
Benjamin.
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
This is all terribly wrong.
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
Wait a minute!
How about art.
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
Yes I do.
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
What novel did you read.
We don't.
No we don't.
About five years.
Is it?
No.
Think real hard, Benjamin.
Not particularly.
Art.
Oh my God.
Why not?
There's nothing to tell.
I was just kidding around.
But why shouldn't I?
Let's drop it.
Yes.
I wouldn't know.
Of course you did.
But if it's sickening for you --
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
Then you'd better start believing me.
Where is Elaine?
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
But I don't want you to make up something.
No.
I do.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
About what?
To be what?
Swell. I appreciate it.
Oh no.
No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
Ben -- how old are you now?
That's a hell of a good age to be.
I'd like to hear it.
I will.
I will.
Mr. Robinson?
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?
Dad -- can you listen --
They are?  Come on.
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.
Every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it.  Baron, you know -- I've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the -- 
I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
No.
Why?
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
With the pearls?
What about the money?
Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
No -- why? -- should I?
Very little.
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
I feel sorry for him.
I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
Yes -- oh!
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
So alone.
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear -- 
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---
Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. 
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
When are you leaving Berlin?
I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
No?
General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
Yes, quite.
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
We could come to my room.
No -- not at all.
Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again... 
How's the beautiful lady?
The war dropped him here and forgot him.
Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
Be quiet.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. 
Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.
Good heavens. What for?
No, Doctor.
This gentleman can have my room.
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, -- 
Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I had pain I'd be too happy to notice it...
I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
Yes.
Money!
Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?
Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.
Moreover --
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
That's from skiing.
Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
Well, he's a gentleman!
Why not?
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
He likes to play the great man.
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
In that case give us the articles. We'll sign at once. We know all the details...
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
But, Madam. cannot do that.
Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet.
Send it away -- I shan't need it.
Good morning, Madam.
Oh, yes, Suzette.
Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov? 
Oh -- but it can't be.
Such nonsense.
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
There was -- there was.
An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
Don't worry about me, Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself.  There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four.
Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a cheap room? Did I?
No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every day is precious -- every hour -- Every minute.
I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one.
When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.
Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
Well -- gentlemen.
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
I want to keep my teeth.
Bobo, no, I --
My son --
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
Fine.
Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!
Goody!
It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
You know who I work for.
My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
Lead on.
So I heard.
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep everything the way it was.
I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
Thanks, uh, Lilly.
And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!
No. And you have to be.
We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
I pay my debts.
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
I've really got to --
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
You must have some money.
And Myra's stuff?
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
I know you do, so that's why --
Oh, you'll live, Lilly.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
That's right.
I don't see why not.
A future. The only future I've got.
What?
I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent.
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
Taking you for granite?
Are you sure?
Mm?
And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
What happened to Cole?
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is.
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
Oh, yeah. That's that.
We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.
Happy to see you looking so good.
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
The cemetery...
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
No.
My point exactly.  See, we both agree.
Will, sit down...
I don't know.
Get on the bus.
Please, get on the bus...
Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
I did alright.
Shit, Linda!
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably just lonely.
He's in the bathroom.
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
Guess so ...
Then they can watch.
Answer what?
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
But I've seen him!
No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
It's ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers!
Black magic ...  'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'
Wait a minute ...
But surely Rogers isn't --
Or what's left of him.
Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
This is madness, Wynn.
It was you.
Samhain.
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
No!!!
Didn't recognize you.
I'm gonna wet my pants.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
You know what gets me?
Must have changed that law.
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
Go home!
Go home.
That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
The educational process.
Sorry.
When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
I dunno.
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
Maybe it's time you got out.
You're an imbecile.
Everybody thinks that.
You've come to the right man.
I just want one true adventure before I die.
You're making a joke.
For what?
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
Thank God!
As a matter of fact--
Is anybody besides you here now?
I'll see.
I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
Everybody says he was so brave.
They were in the same creative writing class.
She has a master's degree in English literature.
He insults him all the time.
What's good about that?
England?
"The sting."
And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia."
Go ahead.  No, no, no, no.
I can't take my eyes off you.
Penelope!
Will you go to bed?
Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
Who was it?
Nothing.
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
I don't want to fight you.
It's your house, Dad.
The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man.
Give us time.
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
I did?
I have a brain.
That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
People don't use that word any more.
Yes.
No you're not!
It's a big and busy funeral home.
I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
If he thinks he's man enough.
May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!
No.
Don't!
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
There it is.  Give it to me.
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
It's always locked.
He's dead, you know.
Oh dear.
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--
Chills, fevers, sweats.  You can describe it and name it after yourself: "the Woodly galloping crud."
Would you say that again?
We'll find out now, won't we?
And terror, if you don't mind.
You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
No!
For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.
Thank you.  You can leave now.  We'll begin.
I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
Jesus.
No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
I dunno.
Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink.
Don't worry about it.
I'll kill myself.
All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
He's alive!
If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
It's beautiful.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Don't know.
That man is your father.
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
Then get him.
Oh?
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
That's when I'll get my confidence back.
Yeah.
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door.
How long has this been going on?
I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
Take plenty of cigars.
Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
Tonight's the night.
That's the XKE.
No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
Meaning?
I'm amazed.
And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!
We met here earlier this evening.
Tell her to have a nice trip.
You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
Which we do.  But we can stop doing that.
You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines.
What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
You mean I'm black?
What are you doing?
If he has anything to say about it, yeah. I've been asking a lot of questions and I don't like the answers I'm getting. He's made a lot of people nervous, including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star.
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
Sam?
I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's going to be in it. He said you might know where Tod is.
Last I heard he went to San Diego.
Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
No. But does it make any difference?  How did you get to be the way you are?
You used to work at Copper Penny?
Not very.
So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
Do you live in a house back in wherever.
Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.
My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money...
Where is he?
Who's paying you?
Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
What have you found out?
No.
I don't know.
Who made it?
What's it called?
Research, my ass. I suppose these are the 'extra expenses' I've been paying for? And in the middle of the morning, too.
I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
Wes, Anne, come here a moment.
Pretty good.
How did you find me?
What?
What is going on?
What will I tell the others? They care about you.
That's not true, Mr...?
That's not true, Jim. In fact, I think you're very close to the type we're looking for.
Rucker.
What we got is just these here.  What you see.
They're all about the same. You want something?
That's all right.
Film making can be pretty expensive...
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary.
I'm worried about Jake.
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.
Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
Then whose name is it registered in?
Wait here.
Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Southern California. So you can imagine.
A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one.  Tell me, what do you see?
Harold Chasen.
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
Oh, at the dentist's?
Eh, fine.
Oh. Eh, I like it.
Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.
But this is public property.
Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
Well, I don't...
I don't know.
It's all right.  It's organic.
Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
Pray? No.  I communicate. 
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
Where's that?
Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
I took them out.
They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight.
But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
Well, actually, it was the name of my drama teacher - Louis Sunshine. Perhaps you've heard of him. He was such an influence on the development of my instrument. That means my body - in theatre talk. Well, when I came to Hollywood I felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form, so I took on "Sunshine." Dore is my real name... Well, Dore, actually. My, what a lovely place you have here.
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
Ah, yes.
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
I don't know.
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
I go to funerals.
I burnt down the Chemistry building.
No.  I'd have liked to.
Thank you, Uncle.
You think so, sir?
Oh sure.
Harold!
She took my head.
Oh yes. That's fine.
Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
It certainly is.
Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
So you slept O.K.?
Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know.
The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?
WHY?
What are you talking...
It's been Hell.
Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell.
The mattress... The mattress... JULIA.
Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
I'm lucky that way.
Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
Air and sea backup. What's closest?
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
My job.
Those comics -- They never got the eyes right.
Well, let's see -- there was that moment, when I had a train on top of my head --
Not hungry.
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
I've changed my mind. I'll come to Moscow. If you -- are still going --
Red, I --
I like that...
Marco...
Cocky.
-- Late. Five minutes late.
Two steps back, please.
Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
We're leaving.
It'll go in.
Julia's my second wife.
Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
It's just a puzzle box.
Who are you?
No!
No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
I have to speak to my father.
I don't remember.
Oh Christ.
No.
What? What will you do? What CAN you do?  There's nothing to be frightened of.
Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
Oh.
I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
Oh my God.
Tell me who you are.
What do you want me to do.
What kind of doors?
Hell...
Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
Like who?
The best part of ten years.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
Oh Christ. Julia...
I hear you.
He's BEEN here. There's stuff in the kitchen. He must have made a hasty exit.
I cut myself.
I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
I'll be scarred for life.
O.K.
I've seen worse.
What's wrong with you?
No.
We don't need a bed, do we?
What happened to me?
I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
Try me.
I got through.
I found a room.
I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
Is Julia here?
Surprise.
Sure.
She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
What?
Gone?
I don't believe it.
Yes!
I have to get out.
Just upstairs.
I AM house-trained.
Please. I want to see you home. All right?
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
What happened to you?
I don't know.
I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
What do you mean, "what?"
Ehh.
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
We're getting that anyway.
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
That's what we want.  Reaction.  And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll be ready.
Do not get ahead of yourself.
Nothing.
Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
You can be and are wrong.
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
What do you mean, four more?
Fine.  That's great.
What's his name?
Haha.  Right.  It's no problem.  I love making tapes.
Well, I'll just make it for you.
Yeah but more than that.  I'm happy because I'm proud of us.  Because although our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage.
Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray. Ian.
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
Think about it, Rob.
We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
I thought I could give you a lift back.
Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
You really believe that?
No.
No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
Fine.  One.
Nevermind.
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
Will you please just go?
Have you slept with him yet?
You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.
You do, huh.
You still together?  Going all right?
I hate him too.  So I just call him "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy."
Those aren't mine.
Uh... No.
Mmnn.
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
You're being stupid.
No use.
I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
I mean it.
I don't know.
Are you persuadable?
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
Well call her mother.
Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one.
Naw.  Those are for us.
Sure.
Go to hell.
Thanks.
You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
Tradition.
You are being foolish.
Yes.
It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg.
Yes.
A factor of age.
You won't.
Of bodies.
You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
All of it finished.
No!
What makes you so sure he's the one?
I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?
What are you doing man?
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
You know me home.  Me name.
You are the same?
It is less.
This is madness!
This can't be.
Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help.
Muy Bien!
Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.
But why be so concerned about me?
Of course.
That is not me.
So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
Who?
You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.
I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
You're not talking sense, Mara!
So sure?
Mulet.
It can be different.  It must be.
Must he go?
We ran down that Church Hill info. She's right.  There is no Richard Taupin.
Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
I don't know.
And the Bulgarian?
How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
You were never a kid.
You're wrong.
It's all we have.
Leave her alone.
And if I refuse?
American.
Your murder weapon?
Do you?
His only kid.
We were very close.
No.
Why don't you fellows get your own news?
I'm getting married tomorrow.
Open this door!
The poem?... The poem was great!
No. Roy. Roy V.
Sort of a Jack London style?
It doesn't have to rhyme!
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
I'll come a-running, pardner.
I'm sure you haven't any.
The Criminal Courts Building.
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
We'll explain the whole thing to them. 
Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  Walter!
Thank you.
I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
Yes, I know...  Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
How?
Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
Say, I want to be sure, too!
You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
You'll ask me to what?
Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.
Get out of here, you!
Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
You -- you --
Well, haven't you got anybody else?
Keep away --
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
No kidding?
I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
I'm finished.
What did you do with her?
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
Don't tell me you were worried!
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
What's the matter with my brains?
Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
Walter, you can't do that!
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
What's that -- what's that?
Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.
You got plenty of money?
You're crazy. Where's Mac?
They can't do that to me!
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
What's the use? I can't win a pot.
What's the dope, Sheriff?
Three sixes. Is that any good?
Now, where is he?
I can't complain.
Little rum in yours, too?
Just coffee.  And you, sir?
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
Hold her, boys!
Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
What?
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
I never saw him before!
Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
I'm telling you!
What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't know what you're talking about -- but is this Mr. Baldwin's wallet?
Mother!
Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
Huh?
The what?
I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here!  Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account.
You're insane!
A very fine-looking women.
I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --
Look out where you're aiming, will you?
-- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --
His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
I know.
Apparently so.
Looking for shrapnel.
Yes, you was. Make him talk.
I only know one.
Bugger off.
Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
He's the worst liar.
...and six...
Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
I don't know?
I swear I don't know.  Here's your Christmas present.
Please yourself.
Thanks. I hope you can come for the launching.
Weeds will grow, Mac.
If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.
Bugger the Buffs.
And I'm still just a lad myself.
You taste it.
The ideas you get in your head.
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
Grace!
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
I know you mean well.
I don't mind it. It was harder before the war. Trying to keep up appearances. Now it's patriotic to be poor.
Yikes.
What?
I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.
Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
OK.
The animals have got nothing to do with it.
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
Fucking great.
Now, what makes you think that?
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about?  A great American.
Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
I don't know.
Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit.
Fuck. I think we blew a tire.
He won't move.
That food...  ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke.
We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
What?
Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
Just sit back and enjoy the show.
Quiet.
Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.
Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.
I hear ya.
No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.
No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.
I don't want to see that.
Fried chicken.  Anybody want some?
Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
When?
Shhhhhh.
I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
No please, let me sit this one out.
Tell me about it.
Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see anything now, it's too dark. Let's forget it.
Not yet.
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Yep, I suppose it is.
Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
Great.
I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?
You said it, not me.
No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em before...  ...he looks familiar, is he on TV?
Wait, I want to say good-bye.
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.
How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
I always favored the Hulk.
Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
Uh...  We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp.  A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?
No "buts." Go to your room now.
Nothing! I'll be out in a minute!
Great.  God, I've wanted you forever.
Woof.
French?
Shit.  Hi, honey.
You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
Unnhh.
I just want to talk.
Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts!  I love you, Gabrielle.
Where do we look for little lost Puff?
I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
Shut up and tell me.
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
Oh, Rosie.
They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, "Ewww. A slug."
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
How's it going?
Paper or cloth?
What's the larger experiment?
Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?
I'm not sure.
We are animals after all.
Yes, and...
Nathan!
Why certainly!
Terrific. Can't wait!
I think he's feral.
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
Nothing. Be right out.
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
Your entire body?
You have to shave? Like an ape?
Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.
Of course not.
No.
Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
Sure. Of course.
How come?
Thank you very much for that.
Should I come with?
Yes.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
Ugnh.
Lila?
Yahoo!
Even better.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
And how do you feel about Gabrielle?
Yes... Derek.
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
Hey, he's right!  Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?
Soon as I finish my coffee.
For whom and for what?
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
Thank you.
It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
That's the way it's done.
The night is two thousand dollars old.
What did he say?
Yeah? Why?
Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?
In that case, you owe me another drink.
Whaddya been so far?
What's that supposed to mean?
Thanks for the drink.
That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
You think I can lose?
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
I been thinking.
Miss Packard. How do you do?
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
Means I got confidence that he's a loser. All the way a loser. You happen to be about only one-half loser -- the other half, winner.  I'm finished.
Good. I'd hate to think I was putting my money on a cripple.
Come on, let's go...
It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it.  Go upstairs and sleep it off.
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
How're the hands?
I said we're leavin'.
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
It's a long walk.
You want me to tell her for you?
I'm a businessman, kid.
If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
You well-heeled, partner?
Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
Fast and loose, man.
Give me a drink, will ya?
Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
What's the difference where? I'll raise it.  Is it all right if I have another drink?
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
What for? To play Fats again?
How much?
I don't play pool, Mr. Felson. I play billiards. My house, my game. You don't have to play if you don't want to.
Oh man, you're way out of our league.
Half and a dollar.
Ten dollars.
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
Yes.
What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
What did you say that for, Sarah?
Eggs. How do you like them?
Haven't you opened it?
You wanna drink?
Would he know?
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
Nothin'.  Want another drink?
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
I'll be up later.
Would you get off my back, Sarah? Once and for all, will you get out, will you GET OFF MY BACK?!
That's right.
I'm shootin' pool, Fats. When I miss you can shoot.
So do you, Fast Eddie.
With them?
Dark and large.  With vines -- no, not vines.  Not alive.
What?
Have you always had it?
What's inside?
Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now I... remember.
Yes.
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
I want to talk.  I just learned again.
Stay alive.
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
Well, it's not supposed to be done anyway.
I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
And that one -- to the right of Rigel?
That's a doozy of a dream, son.
That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
About what?
No.
'Cause he wouldn't lie.
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
I don't see anything.
There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something.
What happened to your other slipper?
What? -- I... 
It's really nice of you to help us.
David, don't...
I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?
Think nothing of it, Spanky.
More than likely.
Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man.
Haven't you been watching?
What happened?
I'm thinking.
Dad...
College nickname.
Moishe, please, don't talk.
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
It's not me. They're overriding the system.
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
But Mr. President...
Better than we thought.
Then find them.
Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
Yes, I am.
Butt-munch.
You know me...
Yeah, but what an entrance!
He's my angel.
Don't be. I'm not. It's good money.  'Side, he's worth it.
How to kiss ass.
I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
We're leaving.
Yes.
People are dying out there. I don't think "exciting" is the word I'd choose to describe it!
Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold... probably why they're interested in our planet.  Hey, you wanna see them?
Peace? No peace.
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
And I am his.
There is no museum in Iskenderun.
Yes. My treat.
It looks like a converted church.
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...
How dare he?!
My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?
I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones?
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
I usually don't.
Lower me down.
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
You had it? You didn't trust me!
My father didn't want it incinerated.
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
I can reach it. I can reach it...
And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
Right.
He was actually there? You saw him?
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
Look, can we discuss this later?
Don't worry. He won't.
She talks in her sleep.
Try and burn through the ropes.
I'm out, Dad!
Brody's this way.
All right Dad -- tell me.
But what are they? Can't you remember?
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
Relax.
That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!
Actually, I was a wonderful father.
Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
This could be close.
Dad, we're well out of range.
You call this archaeology?
We named the dog Indiana.
Who are you?
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
You think so?
Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?
Dinner? And with a prince?! My luck is changing. But look at me -- my god, I've to get ready!
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
I am only his humble servant, but the Maharajah usually listens to my advice.
A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
Maybe... but how do you explain The Thuggee shrine I saw right below the palace?
When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!
That's it. Pankot Palace.
Just a statue.
Nobody's perfect. The way I heard it, you stole one of them from a small village.
Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
Long ago -- before my father's father.
Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead.  Oh no... I ripped my dress. Where are we anyway?
He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall down.
Their children?
First of all -- don't panic!
Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got.
Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
You're talking to an authority in that area.
Don't catch cold.
I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing!
Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
They think I'm insane. Tell them I'm not, Indy. Please -- help me ...
I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
Yeah -- this time you're gonna help!
Not quite.
I'm...inside you.
What's going on?
Don't do that.
Yes?
Who am I?
Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
You're gonna explain.
If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
Outrun them.
Then what are you stopping for?
Can't see a Goddamn thi..
I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
No. Don't tell the guards.
Find You?
With Authority!
Take a left and your next right.
Nothing!
What about it?
You are in trouble. Now do it.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
Just get there.
The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
Good Idea!
Little late for that.
Where are you going? Wait!
What was?
Follow it.
She's beautiful...! What do I do?
Try another language.
Wait.
No...you idiot!
I made it work.
Well you did it today.
But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
What are you looking at?
Looks like...the optic nerve. I can see out!
Are you serious?
How do you know?
This just won't work.
You can't listen. You can't watch either.
It wasn't like that.
You found her.
That's good. It's not better. Where?
Osaka?
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her.
Don't worry!
Drink lots of water.
Probably.
Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...
Come on.
Just say the words. Just like I told you.
He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people busy. We were too fast for him.
Aim what?
The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
Looks like you can have all you want.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
Do what? What'd you do?
Dieter?
In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.
It's a long story.
Who's our little man?
It's the least we can do. After all, it's our responsibility.
And how do you service foreigners.
What?
Oh.
Do what?
Oh.
Oh....Sure.
Been hearing voices.
I noticed you staring.
A little voice in my head.
Thanks, I appreciate that.
Sir?
What's what?
Oh...I can't. Business.
Without what?
Like there's someone else here.
Yes, of course.
Me still. They left you alone?
You talk to yourself.
You did.
You're doing...Okay.
...Naw. Made that up.
There's not much to tell.
No.
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
Beats me.
You've  been there?
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
Why?
I'll come back for you.
Her?
Now what?
Do something!
It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
A drink...
Why not?
It is?
Tear it apart?
It'l be alright.
Hi, Daddy.
You better take a good look! Because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious! Now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire? Either one of those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs? Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor, who's already at Brown & Williamson as we fucking speak?
You got a deal. 
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
I'll take a look at what you got. But I'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you say so.
Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
Okay. Hold on a second... What is it?
It's an alternate version. So what if we have an alternate version? And I don't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable.
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need?
No, I'm not...
I'm not implying. I'm quoting. More vested interests...  "Persons Who Will Profit From This Merger...  Ms. Helen Caperelli, General Counsel of CBS News, 3.9 million. Mr. Eric Kluster, President of CBS News, 1.4 million..."
What about you, you got a crew already?
Okay. 
No, no, we're fine...
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
Okay.  Lowell?
You're sure you want to do this?
Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
Yes, it's on the stove...
Soy sauce...
No, thank you.
Can we talk about this when I get back?
Who's calling?
..."ignition propensity?"  ...you understand any of this...?
You're not listening.  Really know what you're going to do before you do it.
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
You eating with us?
What "Seven Dwarfs?"
How are the rooms? Comfortable?
After we corroborate it. That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show.  Anything else?
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
No. We don't do that.  You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike Wallace. So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity. You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected, TV-magazine news show in America.
That's room service. They usually knock first.  Come on in... Over here, please.
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously.  Where do you work?
Did work.
That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
You charge by the hour?
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
No.
You mean... since this morning?
She sued you for back payments of child support?
What kind of shit is this? I was not on the team, I sparred with the Olympic Team... okay?
ABC...?
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
What?
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
"There are times... I wish I hadn't done it. But there are times that I feel compelled to do it..." "I've -- if you asked me if I would do it again or if it's -- do I think it's worth it. Yeah. I think it's worth it."
There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?
Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
When should we do this?
Chapter and verse.
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
He --
They hate each other --
Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
Howard!
Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.
Is that... one person?
Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like you. And my clients? Whores just like you.
We rest, Your Honor.
Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
Got any symptoms?
Asian? No.
Yes?
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
I think Ming is older than Tong.  What is this?
I'll be right back.
And you must be Mr. Massey.
Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
Isn't everything?
"Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery."
Did you see the tape?
I know you do.
You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.
You just haven't met the right person.
He wants a reconciliation.
Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
Absolutely.
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
So I hear. Is that all?
Howard is a beautiful person.
Miles. Miles. Miles.
You really think I engineered the whole thing. You think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme. You came here to celebrate because you think I'm without morality or soul. You --  sound like my mother.
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
She didn't love you?
She held that against you?
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
Yes, Miles. I accept.
Do you want to sleep on it?
I know.
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
Hello Marylin.
I bet.
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
Please!
Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
He was right, wasn't he?
In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
Oh, God!
I'm dying.
Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
I guess.
Yes?
She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
Mm.
I don't know. I can assume...
I'm not sure.
Sorry.
No. You're not.
What...?
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
Should we counsel fear -- or trust? Should we seek to destroy -- or to build? Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism -- or with love?
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
Who's "Patty."
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
Who's Rex's guy?
Muriel Rumsey.
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her. 
Yes sir. If you'll excuse me, sirshe sent me for a drink.  Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in front of Ellie's door. Andrews enters and knocks several times. Receiving no response, he gingerly opens the door.
Why don't you put me in chains?
In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
I'll get it annulled.
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
Never mindI'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
Oh, hello, Dad.
Stunt?
Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that.
No.
He doesn't think so much of you either.
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 
It doesn't matter.  I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to youmade your life so miserableand mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.
Is that his name?
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
Oh, please, Dad
Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married to  as long as I can get her back. 
Lower the boats!
Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roadsall transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"
Sock her!
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that
What happened to your money?
"Young people in love Are very seldom hungry. People in love Are very seldom hungry . . ."
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
Why, you ungrateful brat!
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.
I found it on the seat.
You must have me confused with
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
Beat it! 
Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
Smart aleck!
Not at all. 
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
I thought maybeuh"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
Yeah?
Um. You're doing all right.
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you
You weren't so bad yourself.
Next week "East Lynne."
I refuse to resign!
Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
Yes.
What?
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
knowbut
wasbut
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.
Hitch-hiking.
You're an expert, I suppose.
You figured that all out yourself, huh?
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
Mind your own business.
What for?
Never!  I'm going in and ask him
A black eye. 
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
Why, he'll be back.
Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
Yes?
How'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that?
Thanks.
What!  Say, listen you!  When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this officeunless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours. 
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollarsand I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
Yeah.
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Who?
Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.
Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time. 
Yeahwouldn't it?
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
Huh?
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, seeand
Orange, New Jersey.
SuresureI'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.
Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
Three, four.  He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...
Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.
Go on, Willie.
At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead serious.  And we're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago.  How did you find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas that day?
When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?
Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
Maybe 'cause there's some rogue element in the Government!
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...
No, I did not.
What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
I see.  And where did you drive?
And then Sunday?
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
Fuckin' A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
Jack?  Jack was a pimp.  A bagman in Dallas for the Mob.  He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our side.  Check out Jack Youngblood. Shit - we almost had Castro.  Then we tried to whack him.  Everybody's flipping sides all the time.  It's fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games.
There were admirals.
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
Bugging the District Attorney's office of New Orleans!  It's outrageous!
A Willie O'Keefe?
Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
David Ferrie.
...and that the four of you partied early into the morning hours...
Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed.  Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy.
Oh, she did, huh?  When I come up I'll show you how Saturday night got invented.
It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A quiet little chat between gentlemen.
Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
Huh?
I remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg.  He limped. Don't get me wrong, he's not one of those, you know, limp wrists.  He's a butch John.  You'd meet him on the street, you'd never snap.  You could go fishing with him, play poker with him, you'd never snap in a million years.  So one night we were over at Ferrie's place.  Having a party. Sometime in the late summer of '63.
You wanna know why?  'Cause that mother fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why!  Nixon was gonna be one of the great Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country.  Got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause Kennedy promised 'em too damned much. Revolution comin'.  Fascism's coming back.  I tell ya this - the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  I jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know shit anyway.  People should know why that sumbitch was killed.  'Cause he was a Communist.  Put me on the stand, go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn story, I'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change.
Boss, the President's been shot.  In Dallas.  Five minutes ago.
No word yet.  But they think it's in the head.
Let's get outta here, Lou.  I saw too much stuff like this in the war.
He's been in trouble before.  Used to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern Airlines, but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14-year old boy.
Take a look across the street.
Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas in '65.  Two in the morning on some highway.  A hit and run.
Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
Allen Dulles?
Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet?  That dog don't hunt.
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
...and your General?
More than ten years.
Never touched me.
The assassination, Jack?
I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.  Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
We can use all the support we can get.  I think these might interest you.
Splendid, love to see them.
If you must know, virtually nothing.
And what would I have to do?
How long do you think it would take me to be appointed?
Virginia.
Six.
Uh huh.
Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.
Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
Are you kidding, it looks great. You wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room. But you can go out dancing in this too. It's a total power suit.
Oh, that's not a problem.
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
I need a favor.
Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home.  Look, I gotta problem. I need help, and you can help me.
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
Hey, Jackie.
She almost sounds scared.
Every step of this goes in my report.  I am now taking a manila envelope from the subject's flight bag.
This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag?
You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
If I were to tell you "no it isn't..."
While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?
That's my diet shit.
Fine.
Okay.
Who do you think I am?
It was the other guy who busted me.
How many trips did you make?
He's got that kinda money?
Cash poor?
If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
Sure.
Uh-huh.
'74, I think.
Are you?
He called you?
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
Right around here, in the food court.
No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
Why?
And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
I believe I said I'd be tempted.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
Set him up.
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
I'm sure.
What's he doing?
I didn't say you did.
I know.
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
Then you don't see him for a few days?
Yeah?
What the fuck is that shit?
Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
What are you doing?
A Broadway shopping bag.
You two meet?
You talk to him?
We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell.
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
What did you say?
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform.
Not in the fitting room.
So what happens now?
Do you think I took some of that money?
Great...  ...Wanda!
I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.
Do you got something for me?
Who you think got your ass outta jail?
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
I didn't tell 'em anything.
Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.
One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.
I do okay.
They already know it's you.
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.
Four days ago.
Susanville.
Bank robbery.
It's a diet thing?
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
We had done time together already.
No.
You live with him.
And your point is?
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
This one.
Okay, Lou-is.
You're outside?
That was Beaumont.
Sure.
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
I told you, man.  She my fine little surfer gal.
Hang it up, she's on her way. You gotta listen to this. This involves you.
You know how she is.
Pretty sure.
What?
You gonna tell me who it was?
Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
He's a big one. You two tight?
Gonna have to put up cash.
They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.
Beaumont. That's the only name I know.
Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
Yes.
Was she?
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
She got off, huh?
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
I know where to turn.
Uh-huh.
No.
It's Beaumont.
I was gonna tell you...
Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
Like Della.
Stop!!!!
Don't bother to call again, okay?
Ah! Well then, they're going to have to pay for that, aren't they?
Used you?
How long had that been going on?
Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on.
I thought you said she didn't say much.
Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
I've seen it. It's all pain.
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.
Save me!
I didn't want to wake you.
Where to?
Thanks.
I don't know.
A good lay.
What's wrong?
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures?
Where?
Where's Della? Bring her here?
The numbers stop at 107.
That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
Coming here?
You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
What?
I love you, Jez.
What? What do you mean?
Jezzie?
It might be for me.
Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
I love you when you're angry.
Sit down.
Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
You've lived with me for two years.
You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
I'm not upset.
Mid-town mostly.
I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
West.
Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
Sit down, Jake.
Sit down!
Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
The Ladder?
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me.
Never?
What is it?
Pleasant dreams.
I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
They're awfully heavy.
That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
Total delirium.
What is wrong with you?
Call my chiropractor.
I need to see you.
You can't talk in Brownsville?
Why not?
What do you mean?
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
How did it happen?
Bring it in.
He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
Punk?
Pause play.
Yes it does.
Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
Delongpre! Out of time!
Sergeant? We thought you were...
And you said high school was boring.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
What are you doing back?!!
You tell me! She's only set one charge. And it's not finished!
Suit up.
I am an expert!
My job.
You just keep an eye out.
No, you're dead! You're all dead!
Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.
Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something?
Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.
400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.
Oh I like her a lot.
No shit. I got no problem with that.
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
Shut up, Thorgan!
Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there.
NO!
Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right?
I get no kick from champaign, mere alcohol doesn't faze me at all, but I get a kick out of you.
Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!
Let's just get out of here.
A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
Oh my God! Adrienne?
Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
Maybe she tripped.
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
I'm afraid I cannot assist.
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
A real mamma's boy that one. Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
Alright, I'm . . .  No way . . . is this a joke?
See you then . . . doctor.
Obviously so.
They can deal with this sort of thing.
Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
What?
You got it.
You got it.
What do you mean 'We...?'
Who's driving the boat?
Get behind me, dummy!  Reverse her and turn -- he's taking too much line!  Wet my reel, quick!
You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark...
Where...?
Dead astern! Zig-zag!
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.
Michael! Come inside!
I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...
Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news.
Thank you.
I was only reacting to what I was told.
I didn't agree to that!
What kind of a shark did you say it was?
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
Let's all have a drink.
What stinks so bad?
I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
I want to check something. Hold my feet.
Be careful, for chrissake.
A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
I wish it would rain...
This is quite a place.
No...  You think we can get back with those?
Just keep kicking.
Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
That wasn't funny.
I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.
Twenty years.
Do I set the goddam hook?
Is that a boat?
We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach.
Look, I don't need to hear any of this working class hero crap. Some party boat skipper who's killed a few sharks...
Anti-Shark cage.
Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing...
Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure...
Thanks for the message.
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
I'm supposed to be running.
I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.
I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
Were we together?
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
No...
I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me? I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Yup.
Yup.
Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?
Excuse me?
No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.
First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
Oh, go fly a kite.
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes.
Sorry. I was just getting something.
Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
Commercials.
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.
Hey, I like this.
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
You're something else.
Why? What the big deal?
I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
No?
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?
Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
No thanks. I'm off pills.
Really? Fingernails?
Room with a toilet, got it.
So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.
What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
Silencio! I just drank my weight in Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto.
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
That is sick, man.
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.
I'm pregnant.
You sound shocked or something.
I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. She seems so nice and all.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
Don't mock me.
I suppose anything's possible.
Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
...Yeah.
Took 'em all.
Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week.
...Anything else?
Jeez... Adele!
Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
Almost.
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
I heard that.
As many times as it takes.
Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here...  Do it Adele... Now!
It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...
I don't know, they didn't speak too good English.
Not so good. You sure you have to?
Vernon, Florida.
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
Who?
Nah... how much money have you got?
No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.
...Ha.
It was definitely the high point of the evening.
...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.
Why, what did he do?
Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em...  Like fer shurr!
Siesta.
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
Oh man... come on, I don't want no janitor job.
No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't.
Was up bitch?
Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
Did what take?
Yeah.
How did she smell? Did her puss stink?
Right.
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
Right.
Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
Can I do it? I just broke her cherry. I imagine I can make her do anything. Bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire.
Yeah me too nigga.
I know what you mean.
How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
So. You never know when you can end up like that.
Shut the fuck up.
I don't know. How much do you want?
Yeah probably.
Hold up man.
What do ya want with Telly? That guy has enough bitches.
Right here.
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
Yeah. Do it again.
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
You have?
Yeah?
Come on.
How do you know?
I don't want you to hurt me.
Yeah.
You're OK?
Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean you're a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all...
A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.
Yeah?
I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
It's like yeah whatever. But when you fuck. You wanna fuck that person. You're like ripping each other's hair out. Ooooh.
Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
It's really slow. It's slow boring.
Yeah.
He still does.
Oh god. That's horrible.
When are you gonna be back?
It's me. Telly.
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
Nah.
That shit is nothin'. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
Yes.
Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
His victims aren't random.  It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.
No it wasn't.
No, I need the original note.
Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
Sit down!
Local?
What was your relationship with her?
I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
Sanderson?
I haven't got time for this.
Did you know her?
We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
Not really.
I couldn't say it any better than Huxley.
You like to brag, don't you?
The police haven't told you?
You sonofabitch!
She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
Never mind.  He died two years ago.
He's in his seventies and lives in Holland.
The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
Don't patronize me!  You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
I just can't believe it.
How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
Uh huh.
How do you know that?  Did he say something?
Nice meeting you.
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
No, but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from Ohio.
Thanks, David.
For what?
Who's Kathy?
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
We're not sure.
Only in passing.  To say hello to.
I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.
We think he might be making a reference to drugs?  Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.
But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
A building?
He uses castles...plural --  then says "can't move me."  Singular.  Not can't move us.
It's over, Peter.  Let's stop the games.  I'm not sending a car.
He knows you're aware of that.
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
How could you?  Unless you were there.
Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
No.
What do you want on it?
Would you settle for pepperoni?
Then why are you backing up?
For emphasis?
But what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  Violent?
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
Can I come in?
It's not that easy.
Frank told me.
He didn't tell you either.
Are you going to come tonight?
That's worse.
Well, you're beautiful.
If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
Never mind my ears! Go away!
Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
I won't leave you here.
I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
I have lived in this place, like my fathers before me, guarding the old knowledge. I knew, when I had no son, that the Great War would come in my time, and that I would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king. Come.
I have no extraordinary powers.
In the old books. It's called a glaive.
But there is another entrance to this place.
She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.
Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death.
You will know, in good time.
Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
Cut. <u>Cut</u>!
You have done it?
Saddles.
Yes.
I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
A forest near the Valley of Needles.
I was hoping I might be your friend.
I have need of friends.
You will follow me.
Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.
Not sleepy, either?
Would you settle for a boar?
And mine goes with you.
I'd wish for a puppy.
It's right behind you.
And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
Hush!
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
I knew.
That I am, my lady.
They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
She has the power to kill.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
No, she was not as beautiful.
It is no trickery.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
Why must you know?
Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
...What?
...Not at all.
Yes.
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
Do you need money?
Good.
Huh... 500 meters?
How can you say it?
Oh really?  But can you miss the car?
Whoever.
Yes, yes...
What?
OK.
You were scared, weren't you?
Yes.
Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
Mathilda?!
What shall we do?
Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
Yeah... I'm just good for left-overs!
Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
...Don't you like me?
...I don't know.
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
Yes.
Good! Snipers can't be in position.
Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!
Huh? Why?
...And how much is it?
Can I sit on the stairways now?
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
Yes... Twice.
I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.
Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.
A couple days to a few months if untreated.
Can it kill me?
We operate.  We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
Pardon?
No.  How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
The flowers... they're beautiful.
Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?
You like to take walks?
I've changed my mind.
You've just decided, is that right?
He's plastered.
I think it's a different place for each person.
Good.
If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.
I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now.
Pacifica, California.
Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
About my love for her.
You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up.
You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
Nine.
This is the route approved by triple A.  Even if you followed back roads the entire way, you'd still be looking at roughly the same distance...
Umm, no.  It's just that --
Maybe.
Pulitzer, here I come.
Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.
Tomorrow.
I told you.
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
I missed you to Mr. Parker.
You were right.  From the heart is always better.
I was thinking you could open another store with investors.  I'm sure a lot of people would want to get involved with you now.
What, come on?
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
Someone should be with you.
Good morning.
Yes.
What do you mean?
No alcohol?
Water?
You what?
Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
No, I can't have dinner with you.
I have to change and take a shower first. If you want to come home and wait.
You OK out there?
Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
Is that really what you want to ask me?
What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
OK.
Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
I know that...
I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears?
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
Right here at the hotel. Why?
A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
Where have you been staying?
That's right.
I can't tell you.
I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.
You're fired. I have new representation.
He's an ass that's gonna try.
You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
How?
No. I was in the shower.
Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.
She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
Who's askin'?
That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
I'm a man who knows what I want.
Yes, I am.
For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?
Forget it. I've already spent too many hours crying over you.
How about --
That's terrible!
Definitely! I love him!
I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner -- I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard-ass.
That's because men are big, fat retards who don't -- Oh, my God...
Relation?
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
Really?
What?
Hell, yes. We've got finals to study for. In Jamaica.
You think?
So?
Your scrunchie?
Power yoga?
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something.
No, she can't move for an hour.
If she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it.
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
Is he the only one?
I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
I just don't understand what went wrong --
What, like on va-kay?
Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
I got bangs!
We're on our way to the bridal show in New York so we thought we'd rescue you from law school for the night.
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
Of course, I do!
Your what?
My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
That's why I think it's time for us to --
No.
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
What, like it's that hard?
Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
I didn't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but I'd bet my next check that that's where he was about to put it.
Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
Yeah, luckily.
Precisely.  Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
Purely a precaution...
This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
I know no more of shame than I do of fear.  I wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
We're both of us damned, my beauty.
What do you want from me?
Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you...
Cathay?
Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
Oh no... Don't you understand?
No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
Faerie ring?
Why, Jack, then tis your death song I'll be strumming.
What!
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
What does she want from me?
Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
And if she thinks me a liar?
And who might that be?
Something's coming.
Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
Blackheart?
Jack, Jack, it's dwarves live here. Hard-working chaps.  Hammering in the forge all the live-long day. Make the most wondrous things, they do.
We're not in a tournament, Gump.  Ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons...
Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
Will you chance a miss?
Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
Fire away!
It's what we'll find there worries me.
... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.
Did you bring me here to sup?
Ah, but you will.  And so will the Baron, when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway.
Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next!
I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
That's it then... the ring!
Screwball!  Be quiet...!  We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
Three cheers for our champion.
They've fired the moat!
Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you.
Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
Never.
Or perchance...
All right.  I'll show you something sacred.
That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
Shhh!
Are you honest?
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
My father and the Baron.
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
I don't want it on me.
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
Oh, la...
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
Only what's right...
I can't have been under much more than a minute.
His feet shall never cross my lips.
Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.
Aye.  And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here.  I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely.
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
Princess?  I know of no princess.
Dead, dead, dead.
Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
Only that?
You... you... you mortal you!
Be fair, Oona.
Up ahead!
No speeches!  What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all...
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
You follow.
What are you doing?
I guess it depends on what you give up on.
Here, honey!
What's wrong?
And why was the alarm on?
Is that legal?
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
I want you to try something with me, okay?
I'll get your back.
Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
I'm not gay.
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
We've known each other since grade school.
A violation?
A sink?
What can I do for you, George?
Uh huh.
No.
No you don't.
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
You're so predictable.
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
It'll be fine.
I'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati.
Oh, okay.
My dad used to play a game.  I never really understood what it was until after he was gone.
You know that great thing, though?  Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one.  It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is.  Or it can just blow you away.  Make you something different in an instant.  It happened to me.
Don't.  I don't want it.
He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
After everything he did to you and your mom?
Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
Well, congratulations!  You fucking pulled it off!
Thanks for telling me.
I know there's an explanation.
Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
Three.
You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
What did you do with your dog?
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
I don't have a phone.
Well, for later then.
Sam's favorite.
What have you been before today?
We have it on video!  Was that when?  My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
He won't use my shower.  I don't get it.
I can hire workers to help me.
I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.
I need to know.
Does Alyssa know?
Don't even...I'm there.
I'm thinking it's too weird now.
His father is a man.
Should I?
We should take a vacation.
I know.
Do you like red?
Okay.
I don't know what I'm doing.
Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want.
Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.
Nigger.
Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
Take care of me?
Yes, sir.
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
I know it begins with a "C"...
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
I don't think so.
Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
Why didn't you take it?
Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way.
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
Yeah, I want some pie.
Don't get all agitated on me. I bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes, I heard 'em talking...
There are people down there having fun. I want to be one of them. I want you to be one of them. On Monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and a fistful of cash.
Here I am.
Still got that ten dollars?
While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes.
It ain't here.
The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.
Claude.
My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet.
You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me?
At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.
I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.
How the fuck are we gonna do that, Ray?!
Whatever.
Let me see that.
My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.
Don't touch that car.
You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him!
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.
I'm all right.
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
'Preciate it. Claude.
Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
That's right. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. You are now inside the gun line...
You heard what the man said! Move it!
My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.
Hey, Ray...
Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.
He must still be in there.
I prefer bourbon.
Well, fortunately, I carry my own.
I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is.
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.
I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
Let her go.
Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
Absolutely not.
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
My mom wasn't a goat?
Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.
It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
She's so nice.
It would be so okay.
No.
That turn you on there, RuPaul?
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
What can I do about it?
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
Everything's fine, pop.
Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
Definitely.
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
How bad?
So go get 'em, Dad!
Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
By she, do you mean he?
Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
We know where to find Nicky.
Peppermint... alright.
Yes, great movie...
Andrew.
Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
Why are you laughing?
My dad's an optometrist.
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
Sometimes, sure.
Basically, yeah.
What was that?
I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
Are you dead?
Okay, I do. Get back up here.
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
I don't know.
Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
I don't know?
No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
Just wondered... what happens?
Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
I'm in my party mood.
Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
Did you ever see anybody renew?
...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
No.  Just no.
He was killed.
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
Thanks... but I have the choice.
Then it's still no.
You know.
All right.
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
A Runner gave it to me.
I let him go... believe me.
That's tomorrow.
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?
But what is this -- why?
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
We'll convince them.
How will they know we're coming?
Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back.
Yes, do you think that's why he looks so sad?
It could be...
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
I don't know.
No.
I don't know... but it does.
Hello.
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
It's all right with me. Is he here?
Gracious... no.
Dead... they're dead... and buried.
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
Okay.
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
What?
This is our bedroom.
It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
Maid? Relative?
Right... This just glided along.
I can't see you tonight.
He works for Mr. Eddy.
He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
Andy?
Oh, yeah?... What else?
Up the stairs - down the hall.
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Sure.
Arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'. They miss you pretty bad down at the garage. I told 'im you still had a "fever".
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
Did you tell the police this?
What happened to me?
The wife killer?
His physical condition.
All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.
No... Here he comes.
You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
What about yesterday?
Who was the man?
Not even close.
I... I didn't say anything...
FUCKIN' "A".
My... My head.
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
Wake me up when you get home.
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
Maybe.
He's got some fucked up friends.
Was there?
No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
No thanks, Mr. Eddy.
It'll be ready.
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
Great question!! In the east... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? It's been a pleasure talking to you.
Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
What night?
You really don't remember?
It was weird...
I don't want to talk about it...
I do like you, Sheila.
Let me have it.  "Aboard the S.S. Manchuria. Last night Conway seemed to recover his memory. Kept talking about Shangri- La, telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet. Insisted upon returning there at once. Locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at Singapore. Am leaving ship myself to overtake him, as fearful of his condition. Wrote down details of Conway's story about Shangri-La which I am forwarding. Lord Gainsford."
Fossils.
I'm a paleontologist.
Uh-huh.
Why, of course. Yes.
Oh, really?
All right, all right. Keep quiet.
Mr. Conway, I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious.
Sounds like a stall to me.
How do you do?
I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
They were.
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?
Then everything is quite all right, isn't it?
Shall we have another?
No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
No.
Oh, I'm so glad.
I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
Then it's done.
Are you so certain you are away from it?
Oh, dear.
Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out.
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.
Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as
But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
I don't know. I can't get the dialect.
It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
Chang! Chang! Chang!
Porters?
George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
So you think I'm mad?
I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well, why don't you go?
What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
Yes.
What's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know.
In for what?
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
Why, you - you Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
You're absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you?
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
Forgiven.  You know, when we were on that plane, I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the distance of the plane. It was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. And I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane, and I'm that silly shadow. That all my life I've been rushing up and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles, never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms.
The first thing we want to do is to cable the Foreign Office. All of England is waiting to hear about my brother. There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready to take him back.
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
You'll tell me some of the things I want to know, won't you?  You'll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what they're going to do with us!
Cowan--
We're the government, Cowan.
What happens if I say no?
Actually, sir--
All the time, sir.
Kay...
Sir, you can't just--
Right.
So what's the problem?
Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  Believe me, you get used to it.
It was a long time ago.-
I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid.  They use it to make our food digestible for their systems.
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
Get back in the car!
Kay.  All I'm saying--
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
That's my point.  For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.  He said our enemy in already here.  Well maybe it is.  Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.
All of it?
I'd double it and add 20.
Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?
There wasn't time, sport!
Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
You know, there's something we never really thought of...
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Why not?
It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.
I understand.  I understand, thank you. --How about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser?
Give or take.  It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last.  We were waiting till your planet was warm enough.
Most entirely.  Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated.
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
I dunno. One?
Nothing.
They're not my pals--
Tell us the truth.  You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood.
The what?
Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.
Fine.  Good.
So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
Just a guess.  But I think found a nest.
Is it now?
He'll turn around.
Anderton, leave.
What is it?
Anderton --
Agatha, you're never going back there.
She died?
She's still alive?
What --
Because I found out about her...
I know... I do, too...
I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
We know each other?
How do I find the --
I can't even stand up --
-- go blind.  I know.
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
Try again.
Don't worry, Lamar.
I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there.  And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
We won't let them.
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
I show a cop on horseback.
No maglev system.
Did he close the front door?
Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
That was easy.
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
Just a nickname.
You gonna tell on me?
Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
Oh... Hi, John.
No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
Good-bye, Dad...
Some -- somebody's father?
He's alive?
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
You're not gonna kill me...
I'm a little dizzy...
I'm... not... a... killer.
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
The system would collapse.
But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
Tell him not now.
Not.  Now.
I'll be right there.
Thank you.  This is Burgess.
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
Wait, just a second...
Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
How?
We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.
That's the Red Ball Alarm.
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
Yes, I know.
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
We can stop him.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
You "friend's" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  Six years, not one damn murder...
Who?
I know who you are.
You mean after he lost your son.
But John was with him at the pool?
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
You're Bobby, right?
What if I gave you forty?
No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
No.
What happened? I thought we were playing Truth or Dare.
We used to take baths together.
And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
She's, uh, sleeping.
Where were you?
They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
Yeah? You sure?
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
Don't get my hopes up. If I quit, what then? I can't go through this again.
Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.
There's no touching.
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
Draw.
5-5-1.
You driving her?
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
What do you mean 'troughed?'
That's it.
She was fast, huh?
I don't understand.
I know.
Yeah. Sorry.
Yeah.
You told him you liked him.
You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
Yeah.
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
You don't know where you're going?
No. That's cool, man.
Yeah.
Yeah, he's getting there on his own.
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
It's important.
Thanks.
So?
I got no idea.
Hey, baby... Nothing. What are you doing...? Yeah, I'll probably cut out early...
We don't need guns.
I'm not taking her to a bar.
This paint sucks. The white shows through.
What's the movie?
As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
Well, I don't want to walk.
They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
Nothing.
What the fuck do you...
Don't even start.
Sold it, stole it, whatever...
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
What did I 'get?'
I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.
Like I said, I don't know.
I swear to God, I didn't do anything.
Did you hear what he just said?
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
It was six in the fucking morning.
No more, man.
Take us right to Kennedy. Now.
I'll be a minute.
Tom. How's it going?
Bobby and Ricky.
And you grew up in Manhattan?
You see a Ricky Slade?
S'up.
Cool. See you later.
I hear the China Club is a laugh.
Here...
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
Couldn't make it. Here's the money.
No, man, that's fine. Just put that you took delivery.
The Soho Grand?
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
So tell me how it is.
She poured it for --
Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
And where might that be?
Well, word on the street is you're Welsh.
Man's rep travels.
'Cause I want in. And it don't take a lot to know you there, daddy.
Just now.
Solid, daddy.
I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.
Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.
You know it.
'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
You the only cat don't come on with that "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that.
But the key to Islam is submission. That is why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
There's nothing to talk about.
Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
Just hold me.
We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
What do you want me to do?
You have to sleep for three.
Betty it's me. It's me.
Let some of us come down there.
Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.
Just what is your question?
I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black.
For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "Do you hate me!" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate.
Sure, man.
I say a lot of things.
Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.
Burglary, count one -- 8 to 10 years; count two, 8 to 10 years; count three, 8 to 10 years...
Please make way, please --
You hear me, girl?
What's your story, baby?
Eat lead, coppers.
Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for size.
You the man!
So what about him?
That's right.
What do you want?
[South America.]
[I'm on to Juarez.]
[I have a friend there.]
I have connections.
[Aurillio Rosas Sanchez.]
[We have an ATM bank card. We draw out 300 dollars every two weeks.]
[No!]
[We don't know! We never see his face! We have to wait in the other room. He was screaming to the girl that...]
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[Not for a long time, sister.]
[How do I recognize him.]
[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
Yes.
Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.
Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
Different door. Not far from here.
Who's Emilio?
No.
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
Yes.
Yeah. Two or three.
I know you're not.
There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier.
Because...  I was already dead.
I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
Then don't come.
I know! I just had to let one go because I couldn't afford him!
[Yes.]
[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
When?
You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.
Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
I think it's fantastic.
What? Who?
Why? You were so pleased with him.
[It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]
[And left three more dead men.]
I already ate.
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
What makes you say that?
My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.
Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
Come on over about half past seven, we'll think of something.  Hello, Ma, what's the matter?
That's nice. I gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.
What happen?
You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.
Were the lights on?
Catherine, you are a blanket of gloom. Wherever you are, the rain follows. Someday, you gonna smile, and we gonna declare a holiday.
I'm having a very good time, too.
I'm thirty-four.
Thank you.
Yes, I know.
I don't.
I'm afraid of being lonely.
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
Maybe that would be a good idea.
Nothing.
I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
Where you going now?
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure can write.
Tomatoes.
Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
You gonna get married.
You gonna die without a son.
We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School.
What, Ma?
Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
Hey, Marty, come over here a minute.
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
Well...
Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
We gotta ask Marty, of course.
We want you to do a very big favor for us, Aunt Theresa.
I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
I don't wanna talk about it!
I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?
Didn't recognize you, Red. When you get the clamp all the way down, open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery.
I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
That's right.
Hospital.
Where you think you are, boy? They probably never seen a olive in this country.
You make a mean martini, kid.
When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.
What's there to do? You found the sliver.
We sure don't aim to cause any trouble... Yeah, she seems to grow on you.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
Don't tell me about your problems, boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon.
Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.
People will talk.
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
A football game?
At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.
I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry?  Thanks for the drink, boys.
All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.
If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
The Painless Pole plans to cross the Great Divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out.
You want it straight? Medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving.
'Course it isn't, but how many chances do we get to go to Japan? With our golf clubs.
Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive.
How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
Oh, Jesus.
I don't get it.
They're coming.
On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him.
He can move in here with us.
Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
No, thank you. I'm not the slightest bit interested.
No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.
There's nothing ridiculous about it.  A kid like you...
No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
Something else we have in common.
Of course not.
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
Thanks.
Tell me the whole story, Walt.
There's only one worth noticing.
Homosexuality.
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
Well, I'm sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces.
You can cut the bow.
Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
You mean who hit who?
I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.
Yes, sir?
One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
I'm afraid so, Colonel.
Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
Oh, get out of here!
Morning, Radar. How were things?
I can try, sir.
Damn.
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
I used to throw the javelin.
Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
May I have the surgeon's name, please?
Now?
Nice.
Nice.
Yeah. Lavender and old lace!
You got me.
Oh, yuh did, huh?
Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied
Who?
Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?
Yes, I did, John. But II had no idea what was going on.
And, Miss MitchellI think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
No, no, nothat's your seat.
Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down.
Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
What's that?
What letter?
There is no letter.
John Doe.
Oh.
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel roomunder bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Take it easy, John Doe.
No, no, no. Now that's too much!
That's fine, honey. Now, get out!
You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
He's watching the other door.
Go out and find her!
What?
Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.
. . . Tubby?
What Bert's trying to say iswellwe need you, Mr. Doe. There were a lot of us didn't believe what that man said.
Ththat's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background.
Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
It must be some kind of a gag.
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
No, sir. That spot under the bridge where we slept last night's good enough for me.
You bet I will! As fast as I can! Gonna get some canned goodsa fishing rod, and the rest I'm gonna give away.
Yeah, you bet!
Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for
Whyuh
How?
Okay, Beany, bring 'em in one at a time.  Wipe to: Montage: Half a dozen different types of hoboes appearand in each instance ANN shakes her head, negatively.
No, I didn't.
Well, the paper said there were some jobs around loose. Thought there might be one left over.
Did you write itor didn't you?
Nineteen!
Well, you know how they are in baseballif a guy's mixed up in a racket
Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you?
And another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you?  Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped his gloveflopped into a chairand has taken out his ocarina.
How?
Yeah.
Hold him.  Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.
No, sir.
"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
Good. I don't want to be late.
You can't help me, man.
Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
Is that where you're family lives?
We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
Roper, we're into it...
Yep.
Is that all?
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that.
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
Not the ones I'm at.
Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.
Thou shall have no other God before me.
I do.
He'll be running at the quarter pole.
The jockey!
How much you wanna bet?
Occasionally you lose.
So what do you want to do?
Good question.
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
I ain't interested in your life story.
What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
I'm not drunk. Yet.
Scott, You can't save everyone.
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
If you did, you never showed it.
I was going to catch the last half on TV.
Mmm, needs a little something.
Just now.
It's very nice.
A deeper level?
Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
Define concern.
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
What do you think would be in order?
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
Who's running it?
Who's running it!
I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
Because I took it out of your memory.
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
No, not me, I've been lucky.  But I've seen what happens to other people --
Guests?
Nothing, go back to sleep.
In here I am.
Yes...
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
-- Two million people plugged-in here.
-- He will.
-- He won't.
Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
It's not used for anything.
That's right.
Good question.
Where?
Tanner.
-- You told me.
Who are you?!
-- The inside?
That's not possible.  No one can do that.
Once they digitized you, they added it.
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
Just like that?
Destination?
Checking connection.
What?!
The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...
What does that mean?!
Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin!
I think so.
Ryan's Comet!!
THERE'S THE COMET!
WE'RE OUTTA HERE!
We could smell it's breath.
BULK!!
Wait for me!
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that.  Not to worry.  I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!
What do you mean "basically"?
GO POWER RANGERS!
LET'S DO IT!?
And I ain't no nigger either!
The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?
But I've never served a day.
I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.
But ya got a Boss.
Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
Not another word.
I guess I am. Just a little.
Scared.
Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
What's that divided four ways?
From your mouth ta God's ear.
He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
You got men on Profaci's place?
How's Bugsy doin'?
Who hired the bastard?
That ain't what your mama said.
Ya ignorant Guinea, it's kreplach.
What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
It's too late.
London?
I'm very sorry... I didn't...
You must be feeling better, if you're looking for sex again.
As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
We'll make 'em, and we'll enforce 'em. All of us. Together. We all get one vote. Includin' me.
I don't care what anybody calls me, Joe. Long as it ain't to dirty. And if you fellas get together every year and say, "Charlie, we still want you to run things for us", I ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no.
Lansky. Meyer Lansky. And that's Bugsy Siegel ya got there.
So what is the problem?
I'm supposed to be at my old man's for Christmas dinner at eight.
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
I'll talk to Nucky. Get you set up like the fuckin' Prince of Wales.
Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
I'm gettin' married in six weeks. I'll already be in Atlantic City which is probably the best place to do it anyway.
I told you twenty!
Who?
Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.
What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.
I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
He's trying to make it.
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
Not if they all die at once.
A mother-fuckin' peace conference.
The kid just called me stupid.
I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
Sittin' around gives me the piles. You got a proposition?
I got partners.
They do what I tell 'em.
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
I turned him down flat.
Shuddup.
Anything!
I don't know. I guess it was...
Yeah...before your time.
He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell.
I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
They had a case like that at Johns Hopkins. Wires got crossed between hands and feet.
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting, and the carnival rides, and watching people's <u>nightmares</u>. And of course, I need not <u>add</u> -
<u>Why</u>??
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute <u>horror</u> of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
A piata. That's a <u>great</u> idea!
YOU SET ME UP!!
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
What's the "bad" part?
Give me a date, Doctor.
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
<u>What</u> union?
Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you. There's gotta be something I can do.
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
Uh-huh?
I'm good.
I don't want to talk about it.
That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
Oh, I hope so, dear.
Mm hmm.
Oh.  I thought today was Saturday.
Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
Oh.  Well, that would be a ... change.  Thank you, Mrs. Peterson.  You have a very reassuring voice.
This way?
Oh, yes--they're fine people--regular people.
Thanks very much, sonny--
Let's send out a pigeon!
Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
Would you settle for a husband?
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
Wait--wait. Let's see--watchdog McGann-- he's bound to move right in--get him out of the way first--  Pardon me, friend--I've got some telephoning to do--! 
What do I play?
Paine.
My friends?
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
Well, let's get going.
Yeah, I know. That's okay.
Why me?
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
Nonsense.
Why, I think it's very sweet of the children--
Well, your children are very bright-- and *they* say Jefferson Smith.
Relax, Happy. Jim said to wait.
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--
Is *what* getting me down?
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
Why, of course.
Well, it sort of got to be--from Jeff just pullin' splinters and things--
Uh--could--could I help--?
Emma! I will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner!
I beg your pardon?
The porter's got them. They're coming.
Look! There it is!
H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--
To--to a reception--uh--for a princess-- I forget her name--
For a question!
Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
Will he *yield*?
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
Mr. President, have I permission to bring into this Chamber evidence of the response from my State?
Now, now, now!  It's all right, Governor.
What?
We'd better see.
Yes, so I was told, Mr. Taylor, but--
J-Jefferson Smith.
Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.
There *what* was?
I know--but you--you're going to help.
Some committee's got it.
Calendar?
Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?
*This* is.
Try sitting down.
Since sixteen or so.
Terrible, thank you.
You win. It's--Clarissa.
Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
In Terry Canyon?
Great.
Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
But--I've done everything I--
Oh--Saunders--
Hurray!
Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
The Senator has no voice in this chamber until the oath of office has been administered!
I--I'm sorry, sir. I--I have a bill--
Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no, gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without--
Well--I can *manage*--
That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
Jeff--meet Mr. Cook and Mr. Griffith-- members of our State headquarters here.
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Okay. See you here.
You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--
You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
--in other words, Jim--with this Willet Creek Dam on the fire--the man who goes to the Senate now in Sam Foley's place can't ask any questions or talk out of turn. We must be absolutely sure of him.
Jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator, however it happened, he's a Senator. This is Washington.
Jim, I won't stand for it.
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
Jim, you don't have to--
Senator Paine.
It was *I* who rose in this Chamber to accuse him. He is saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence--
Some people like it.
Who's that?
Yes, you own it.
Uh-huh.
No, no children.
Thank you very much.
No.
Yes, but I
What's that got to do with it?
Yes!!!
Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
Look, this is my house. I'd like to
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
What are they going to do?
Yes.
What did he play?
He did?
Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
Are you? When?
Yes, of course.
I'm crucifying him.
Yeah, then what?
Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
Hello . . .
Yes, sir.
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir.
That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
Me sir?
Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
But your honor
Wants to know who the heir is.
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney
Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
Buffer?
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  Tell him to see me at my office.
How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
No, thanks.
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
I don't think we've got any suitcases.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
Shut up!
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
A child? My uncle's?
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
Well, I play the tuba.
Yeah, what if I am? What about it?
Yes?
No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
Oh, the poet? Where?
That's all right. I got it off my chest.
I don't know.
Don't pay any attention to her.
Christian Svenson.
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
Thank you so much. Good night.
What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me. What did you say?
You're Walter, aren't you?
What two policemen?
Who?
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
What happened?
"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
What's that?
Were you supposed to have a session?
A friend?
I'm fine.
You never got back to me.  ...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome.
...And I from Phyllis.
Oh, for god's sake, Phyllis -- we have no reason to doubt the man! Are we listening to Lionel now?
Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
I don't want to hear any more today.
What?!
It's a thought I had.
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
My pleasure.
A little.
What do you think's wrong with her?
Yes.
Oh?
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
Lily, I don't think even you could know that --
Why do you watch?
...so accomplished.
See that sign -- We retain the right to refuse service to anyone. I'm not going to charge you for this session, but I don't want to see you back here.
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
Don't need it.
You're good.
That would explain it.
Is she a friend of yours?
Mother... go away!
Why don't you tell me?
I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
Maybe you'll catch it.
Sorry... I'm done.
Be specific.
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
Where?
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
Yes.
You're upset.
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
Um-huh.
I'm glad.
Transference.
What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook?
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
What?
Anything... just ask.
It's my bit for the community.
What do you want me to see?
Was it something that happened at school?
First off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. As you can see --
No again?
Really?
He agreed?
How are you?
No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
This --
Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
I wondered what happened to her...
Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
Yep.
It's just a thought.
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
It's not?
Just you.
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.
Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bomb-outs, I found a place in the desert...
Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.
English Lit.
You want my advice? Far out!
Wow.
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
What?
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
And then killing your sister.
None of the above, thank you.
Even?
Sounds familiar.
Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!
Perhaps.
You will not believe it.
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'.
To be hanged.
I am an English woman.
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
Who cares? I don't see no treasure.
No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
Oh that's comforting.
We're about to be shown the way.
The things that get you excited.
Preparation for what?
Who was talking about what?
How?
You don't believe in curses, huh?
No you're not.
Not unless you call me Rick.
Because that's my name.
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
FINE.
Got what?
Right now, I only wish to join them.
My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note.
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.
Um, well, you see...
We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer.
Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
Of course.
Really?
One last tweak.
Really?
And some sandwiches --
Do it, big boy!
I'm the Bowler.
Me, too.
They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
Let's do it.
I thought you'd never ask.
Sure.
Just a waitress.
I'm not that kind of girl.
You're a spy.
Roy.
Or you'll what? CAN ME?
I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
I wouldn't mind being famous.
Yes.
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
My heart died a long time ago.
I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
He's got the fact that he's Superman!
Not a chance!
There's a vague similarity.
But look at him... and look at us.
I can't.
Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
Wait!... Look!
No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.
Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!
Ow.
Oh hi, Mom.
Looking for... the TV Guide.
I always knew that you were special.
This looks like a job for Superman --
The bazookas?
But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
Through there!
I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.  He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.
If I can presume to go into the Emperor's mind, I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow.  When Vienna fell, there was a peace treaty.  When Berlin fell, another treaty.  That has always been the rules of the game.  But what is he to do now if no treaty is forth- coming?  He knows that beyond Moscow, there is nothing, and that, if he withdraws, there remains only a fall into emptiness.
I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.
General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
What forces do you have at your disposal?
Cavalry?
Properly arranged, yes.
It is on this road, sire, following me.
Paris is evacuated, sire.  The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  The National Guard is on duty at the gates.
Come back in an hour.
Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris.
Yes, sir, I am.
I see...
My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog?  I would rather eat Cossack.
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
Yes, sir.  Are you acquainted with her?
No, sir.
Do you have three francs, sir?
No...
But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
Are you trying to insult me?
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.
Promises mean nothing.
Will you be joining us, soon?
Oh, my darling.  I'm sorry, too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.
Yes, yes, please sit down.  I will be with you in a moment.
I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
My God, what do you think?
I know.
If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.
Oh, then you are...
I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
Does she deserve anything better?
That is correct.
What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
It will scarcely be considered credible, perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together.
Anything you need.
Good.
Yup.
I'm his cousin.
Ain't the rest room this way?  I gotta pee.
You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery?
You already in.
Nothing.
I didn't see nothing.
What's the B-G's?
What about me?
Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.
I don't know.  Probably next Friday.
Hell yeah, I remember you.
What are you doing here?
Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.
Delinquent Property Tax Notice... I hope the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if not, back to the ghetto you go.  Wife stays here, of course.
Hurry up; today is Fri-day!  And we gotta hit the high-way!
I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!
No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?
Have you seen Day-Day?
You don't wanna know.
Negative...they vamped.
Bummer, huh?  And Friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day.
I know.
Let it go!
I got fired too.
I know.  I'm sorry.
What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
Shut up!  Where's that other miyatea?
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
What's the matter?
Oooh, ba-by!
What you doing to my nephew?
Sorry.
That's right.
And your husband works for somebody else.
I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?
I love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
Same to you.
Don't worry. She's good with kids.
What's your point?
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
That's right. That gives you...
Let me talk to her again.
You know what I'm gonna do.
No, that's,..that's fine
I think you're right.
I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
Keep it.
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
That's right.
Yeah, all right, listen...
Thank you.
What!?
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
You worthless piece of shit! Gimme that!
Gimme a dollar.
What?
I see. Where is this gun?
Everybody does?
My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
I've done much better ones than this.
Help me get her off the rug.
Shut up.
Keep your eyes peeled.
I kill her anyway.
Only you.
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
I will guard Pearl with my life...
And I won't never tell about the money.
No.
She went.
Yes! Yes!
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
She took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old Model-T --
Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
Bluebeard!
And he killed every last one of 'em!
Come on!
John don't like him much.
I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
You what?
John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!
She's gone to Moundsville.
Yes, I reckon that's it.
John, where are we g --
Dead.
Don't you believe me?
What secret shall I tell?
What's your name?
Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
Tell me another secret about my Dad.
Pearl and John.
He don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time poor Brother Ben told me about these youngins.
No, Harry! I thought --
I -- no, I --
How'do.
It's about that John and that Pearl?
It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low --
Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!
Pearl and John.
It's just made her think... her dreams are real...
Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares...  Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died.
Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
Haven't slept, have you?
One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
Okay, okay.  I think.
Just checking -- keep out of sight!
Who?
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
Just want to talk to him a second.
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
It wasn't that serious...
It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now. 
Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.
I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --
But that's just not reality, Nancy!
They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before.  No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don't feel like it any more.
We should get her out of here...
I mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just... opened up...
Right. Well, she didn't, exactly...
Rod and I are done. He's too much of a maniac.
I have nothing to hide.
Evening gown?
What do you wear in the morning?
And there?
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
Positively not!
How nicely you've fixed the table, Ninotchka.
That's another thing... it's spring.
I know, but if we can't put in all these wonderful things at least let's put in some imagination.  In that one omelet we'll taste the whole of Paris!
Right now it's on the balcony.
But what can we do?... We have to accept.
No, no.
I must be stern with you.
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us? 
Oh, yes, yes.
Good evening, Monsieur.
Emphatically not, sir. The prospect terrifies me. Now, don't misunderstand me, sir, I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that I should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me.
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."
Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
It is Thursday!
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
...the Russia of piroshki... people will eat and love it.
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
I just said let's have a little lunch.  Room service.
Razinin.
What did she say about me?
Two thousand francs.
A day.
Buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas.
You mean you are deserting Russia?
Just looking around.
We can't... but you are so ingenious, Leon...
Don't make an issue of my womanhood. We are here for work... all of us. Let's not waste time. Shall we go?
It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.
Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
Yes. It is unfortunate.
She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.
No visa.
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
What a city! There are the Grands Boulevards... blasted out of the heart of the old streets. The Arc de Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's army. The Opera! And Montmartre... Montparnasse... La Bohme... and now I'll show you the greatest attraction!  It will cost me a franc but it is worth it.  The most wonderful spot in all Paris -- unique! Here, look....  What do you see?
Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today.
That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
Wounded? How?
It's twelve o'clock.
No, that was restful. Again.
You know I want to...
Ninotchka, you can't walk out like this... I'm crazy about you, and I thought I'd made an impression on you. You liked the white of my eye.
I don't like your following me.
This is a place for workmen.
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
Why?
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. McIntosh?"...
I don't think so.
Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it...
I don't think so.
My darling.
From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.
And General Savitzky.
A funny story?
You must, darling.
You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
Comrades! Good people of France!
No speech?
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
Yes... a little white house.
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
No! No!
Yes... a kiss... salute!
I know... it's the Russian soul.
Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...
Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.
We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
Huh?
Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
I'm going, Leon...  but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?
What is this, Swana?
Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
Please come to the point. What is it you want?
I must insist that you leave.
Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
Thank you.
Yes... leaving immediately.
I don't understand.
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
Where is that?
My jewels?!
Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.
You did say it, sir.
But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning.  We don't have the staff to ...
He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
Son of a bitch.
Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes here.
You say, John, cut our losses and all the rest.  But suppose the thing blows and they indict Bob and the others. Jesus, you'd never recover from that, John.  It's better to fight it out instead, and not let people testify ...
John, you don't want to start down that road.  I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night."  This is beyond you or even me.  It's the country, John.  It's the presidency.
John, sooner or later -- sooner, I think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to Richard Nixon.  That he's the darkness reaching out for the darkness.  And eventually, it's either you or him. Look at the landscape of his life and you'll see a boneyard.
You do it.
The "Old Man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
I figured that out.
Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
Jesus!  Did Mitchell know?
Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
Well, no place where they speak English.  That way he can always say he was misquoted.
It's marked.  Also there's June twenty third.  And this year -- March twenty first.  Those are the ones ...
Mr. Hoover was a realist.
There's no secrets here, Al.
You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
I'm afraid we have another problem, Mr. President.
So?
How do you see this?
Howard Hunt is working for the White House?  No shit!  This is goddamn Disneyland!  Since when?
I'll talk to Helms.  Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.
He wouldn't do the makeup.  Said it was for queers.
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
Yeah, we've got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit.  That's top priority.
What?
Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America!
It's Helms -- it's got to be.
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
For God's sake, when does this end?!
Sir ... six bodies.
Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
Is it my turn?
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
What about happiness, Mother?
I said I didn't need a free ride.  I need a suit.
I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her.  Anything but a talk with her.
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
What?
Yes.
... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy.
Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
If things remain as they are ... He's got the anti-war vote.
Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star.  They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.
I know ...
Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office.
A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.
Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of.
Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
What do you mean, Jack?
He's turned into a drug fiend, he shot people from helicopters in Vietnam, he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children.  He sees a shrink in L.A.  He's all fucked up. Now he's trying to be a hero to the liberals ... If he gets away with it, everybody will follow his lead.  He must be stopped at all costs.
Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention.
I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
Yeah ...
Yes.  My mother used to pray ... a lot.  It's been a long time since I really prayed.  Let's pray, Henry; let's pray a little.
What a waste of time.  My writings mean absolutely nothing.
Why?
How did he do that?  All those kids ... Why do they hate me so much?
Looks can be deceiving ...
Kissinger's misunderstood.  He pretends to be a liberal for his Establishment friends, but he's even tougher than I am ...
... but it's not, bottom-line, gonna change a goddamn thing, John.  The question is: How do we screw Ellsberg so bad it puts the fear of God into all leakers?
Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
How do you know that, John?  Did we try?  Are we just giving up like the rest of 'em?  What's Hoover found, for God's sake?
... Any information you have, Edgar. The sonofabitch is not gonna steal from me again!  Can you back me up on this?  Can I count on your support?
You're shittin' me.
Elvis I like, too.
She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
And we got the "big mo"!  We're back!
What?  Win Vietnam, sir?
The hell with 'em.
Sir?
POWs.  And their families.
Sir?
No, sir ...
It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
If I stop ... there'll be no more talk of divorce?
Are you serious?
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
And then you'll be happy?
Then I'll be there for you.
Can I just ask for one thing?
Will you ... would you kiss me?
No, you're not.  So stop comparing yourself to him.  You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it.  Why can't you just enjoy it?
Sometimes I think that's what you want.
When?
Thank you.
You're drunk!
No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
How's that?
Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.
Got a letter from your wife. She writes pretty regular, tells me the family news.
'Predate it.
All the time you spend tryin' to get back what's been took from you there's more goin' out the door. After a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it.
I'm... discouraged.
If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.
Try "old" on for size.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
Strolls right back into a crime scene. Who would do such a thing? How do you defend against it?
You ain't heard from him?
I don't know. My mind wanders.
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
No.
You sure?
No. Probably I don't.
I'm hidin' behind you.
Sheriff?
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
Yes Sheriff.
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
I never do.
I ain't got the money.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
...I need to sit down.
I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
That'll work.
Yeah.
Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back.
Well -- how come?
Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home.
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
Yes ma'am?
What did you tell him?
Why would I let you do that?
You mean the nature of this conversation?
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Where does he work?
Is Llewelyn there?
You expect him?
Just lightin' out for the territories, huh. Brother, I been there... Well...
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
With what?
See about closing.
What time do you close?
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
Sir?
Never mind.  I want a tent.
The kind with the most poles.
Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
Yessir. I understand that.
If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
Okay. We can stop that.
I'm sorry.
You want to change rooms?
You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
That's got two double beds.
What else then?
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
How would you describe him?
I'm a welder.
Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
I don't know. American citizens.
No sir.
Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
Oww! My arm, careful!
No, Elden, I need to...
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.
She said she was in Arizona, did she?
You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
No, I didn't have to.
That's a nice name for what you need...
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
Umm, I don't think that...
"Thirty-two?"
I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
Yeah, me too.
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
What are you talking about?
The day I left you I just drove and drove. I drove all day and all that night, and I didn't go anywhere. I just kept driving. I stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and I sat --
You knew Del?!
I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here.
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
I ran back in to get the phone.
What's so special about it?
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
I came for love...
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
What's his real name?
You made out alright.
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
He has no heartbeat!
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
You said in L.A., anything goes.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
Where are you going?
I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
No, you're not. You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now, if you'll excuse me...
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
...and put them in your mouth.
That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
...that's a good motto.
Should I kill him now?
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
...among others.
Worse... you're in Texas.
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
A doctor on the show... why?
It just didn't fit her profile...
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
Very graceful. Perfect form.
What do you mean?
Oh, five years, give or take.
Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
...who doesn't?
I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
We know that...
I don't know, George...
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
Better.
Sure.
Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
I wish I could help you, but I can't.
"A Reason to Love."
How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, thirteen year'n?
Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.
What about you, Everett? What'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place?
Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.
Good Lord, what do we do?
Now you may call it an unreasoning optimism. You may call it obtuse. But the plain fact is we still have... close to... close to...
Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh- reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney- toad!
I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.
We're adventurers, sir, currently pursuin' a certain opportunity but open to others as well.
Oh my God!
Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?
Problem a p'seption.
Assa good idea, Pappy.
Vernon T. Waldrip.
I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
That's right, honey.
- in the gods - Huh?
Not your...
Well, we need that ring.
Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
It was in his bureau.
That don't make no sense!
Million point two.
What about you, Delmar? What're you gonna do with your share a that dough?
...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken - see, we've been away for several years, uh...
But... but...
It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...
Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
Blooey!
Yes, sir.
I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place.
What for?
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
Maybe we'll be roommates, Seeger, and you'll find out how funny I really am...
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push.  Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!
Yes, Joe.
I don't mean anything by it.
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.
Yes, sir!
No, sir.
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
No, sir.
Yes, sir!
What are you tired from?
Do you honestly think you'll find a boy in that... that officer's school who's serious about marriage?
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
He was. He died.
Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
I'm a little late, that's all.
What do you mean?
No. I never feel like that.
Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles.
Of course there was a baby. I'd never lie about something like that. Would I, Paula?
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
I've never had a girl.
Does it still hurt?
I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show...
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
When I'm good and ready.
Yeah, then if I get jets, it's on to Beeville, Texas.
Twenty-two years ago.
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
Who's got two bucks? It's costing me every penny they pay us just to keep my old Lady and my kids in that motel.
Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration?
She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
Yeah.
Naw.
A little.
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.
But it can't wait.
I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
She didn't.
Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony.
Make her come out.  And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful.  She can't get out of this house.  She can't even think she can get out of this house.  We just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes.  And I don't want  Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger.  That's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven.  So we're gonna seal the place up.  They wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll help 'em.  Make it impossible for them to leave.  Once they come out of that room.
The fuck did you do that for?!
That's right.
Remember that.
You finish.  Then we finish.
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
The kid in here.  The other two when we come out.
I know.
Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them.  We're okay, here.  We can do this, right?
Different tables.
Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room.
Everything okay?
I don't get it.
Can we come in?
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
You wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me I look like hell?  Of course I look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can I go?
A safe room.  An inner sanctum.  A castle keep, in medieval times.
It's just the woman and the kid?
He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear.
This is it?  I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce that here.
What?
I don't think so, but I love her album.
Well, I know that now.
They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
What if I keep dropping?
They're hurting us, baby. Huey locked up. Bobby Seale running all over the country holding things together. Cy dead. Little Bobby... I don't recognize half the faces at meetings.
You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. It's like Huey said, you're more important than any of us.
That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
You know it brother.
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
I got you.
Do you know how easy it would be for you to just disappear. Shit, you wouldn't even wash up for weeks. Do you fucking understand?  I want you to move your ass outta neutral. I want a bunch of Panthers served up on a fucking plate. I want you to set 'em up... armed robbery!!
Yeah, it's me.
Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
I don't know. Look around man.
Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.
No, Panther Headquarters.  Least that way we could hang out more like we used to.
And did you witness the shoot-out?
Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
You mean...
The white power structure wants us to act like savages.  But we're a different kind of animal altogether. We're Panthers. And The Black Panther Party for Self Defense is very painfully aware that America has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country. So we need to organize, we  keep our shit correct! And effect revolution. We revolve the power into the hands of the people. Where it belongs.  Power to the people baby...
We're like policing the police.
Look... can we deal with this tomorrow... I'm tired...
So what's the deal?
Don't I know it. Every brother I knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.
I don't know about that.
What, I don't know how you mean?
And who is we?
Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
I don't know.  But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.
Where is he?.
Why didn't you tell me?
I saw. I saw that big one  hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too.  They take you to jail?
Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.
Thank you.
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
Uh... uh... I...
It worked.  How many men can you raise?
He's not making light.
Thank you.
You couldn't have known.
Yes, sir.
Very well, proceed, sir.
I will do so as soon as possible.
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
Yes, sir.
I understand, sir.
Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
Not yet.  What happened?
You're in no condition to ride.
It's already over.
He tried.  It didn't take.
If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
Flanking riders?
Father?
I should have killed him when I had the chance?
She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan.
I'm not my mother.  I can't have the respect without the knowing.
He left us.
Please.
I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
Goodbye, Harry.
That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
Four, five miles.
Worse.
But father, they might come this way.
Thank you.  Did you finish the upper field?
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn.
I will. Come and kiss me.
Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
Does she love the cat?
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.
Why? For God's sake, why?
No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
Don't worry about that.
No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
Wouldn't wash?
Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids just called him Stanny B. He was half Micmac himself.
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back.
This babe has said enough.
It's Ellie's cat.
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
Louis, the house is beautiful.
Come on--let's parole 'em.
And Church will be fine.
You're doing fine.
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
They'll be anchored on the lee side.  Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island --
She.  Goes.  Free.
Eh?  You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.
I'll torture it out of you.
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.
Now.  No, don't kill him.
Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
Yes -- yes.
Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
Ceremony?
-- then we never would have met.
I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
The trees are taller.
I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
Nor did you, I noticed.
I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
I know.  That was for the smell.
Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
Sorry, I didn't know.
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
I said, no lies.
Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
I knew you'd listen to reason!
You threatened Miss Swann.
Somewhat.
We need to go!
I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.
So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
'Bootstrap?'
I'll lead them away.
Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
It's the right way.
-- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
Yes.
He's not telling the truth.
Where did he come from?
No.  She hasn't.
Please.
Speak.
How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?
Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
She let it escape because she wants me to die.
Who cares!  We've got to find him! Hurry!
You're right.  Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage.
I'm so excited, Icarus.
In the meantime, why don't you find something useful for Dr. Bright to do.
Thank you, sir.
Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
A man?
What did he want?
That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
You know, this and that.
The big house?
It was a long time ago, Daniel.  We were young, different people, heading in different directions. That's all.
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
The nanobot is still inside you. It's programmed to exit through the urinary tract.  We need it as soon as possible, so swallow those.
What?  What's wrong?
The polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate.  So what's wrong?
I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
Yeah.  Old times.
Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
The nanobot... it's not here...
What did you want my hair for?
Like a glove.
Let's go.
I'm not leaving without you, Susan!
Did you think I could just leave you...?
I'm real touched.  Now get your Sunday's on.  We're going for a ride.
Yeah, and what might that be?
It's a miracle.
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
You won't.  That's why you're whispering.
I don't mind her if you don't.
Certainly. Right over there.
You may go, Smythe.
Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
I'm glad.
It isn't cheap. It's nice.
Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters
Gallagher?
Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
Are you crazy?
But I don't want to meet your gang.
Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
Mother!
Thanks, I will.
Oh, man!
I certainly will.
Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody.
Yeah - go on.
Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
A what?
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
My play.
I'm not quitting!
No!
Your valet, sir.
Oh no, sir!
Quite so. Quite.
Now Mr. Smith, now please
There you are. You caught on. You see, you're nice and you're smart too. You caught on right away. Outside! Go on! Outside! And don't come back!
I bet.
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
I didn't run away.
Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Staring at us?
I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Sorry, boss
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.
Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.
I have it here.
Holy jumping swordfish!
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
Pardon me, madam - but what am I to say to the newspapermen?
I've anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate is ready.
Double strength!
"Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!"
I beg your pardon?
I understand, sir.
Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
Me, sir?
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
Well, sir, I putter.
I just putter.
Well sir, I'll show you.
Very good, sir.
It doesn't matter.
No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.
In my handbag.
Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought.
I don't want it to go away.
You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
I think ... I might be ill ...
Why not?
What?
Yeah ... How'd you know?
I'm fine--but thank you.
One of those ... big beds?
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
It was accessible to everyone.
Very well ...
But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
Oh sure it is.
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
What happened?
You--you gotta get us out of here.
What's going to happen?
Neither do I.
We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
What?
What were you doing in a library?
It's in your closet.
So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.
They don't have that kind of potential.
Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
... Yeah.
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
Oh ... Hi.
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
We'll just put up the top.
I like it too.
Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
That's right.
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
I'm going to leave now.
I'm going on trial tomorrow?
Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.  Sleep well.
Yes.
Yeah ...
Just listen to me ...
I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...
Yeah. 
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
D&D Mattress Man.
I'm trying to be your friend.
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
I have work, I can't leave.
It's fine, but --
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
What?
I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
I have no idea.
Nothing. I'm just at work and I'm wondering, you know your friend Lena?
I'm just laying on my bed.
Are you watching a porno movie?
What do you mean, "really?" Yeah. Really. What about you?
I do pretty good, I think. I wish I was making more, doing a little bit better. I can,t get over a certain hump. I will...I will crack something soon I think and really do better...I'd like to diversify...but I'm doing great, I think, as a start.
No.
Ok. SEXY VOICE Yeah...that's it...God I Am So Horny...I wish I was there to help you.....I wish I was there for you, Barry.
You don't even know how much it is.
Really? Please?
Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.
We got disconnected before....
I don't know.
I don't know.
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
Yeah.
Hi.
No. Not at all. It's nice.
Really?
Ok.
It's Barry.
...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
No, no. I did.
Yeah?
You were talking about the promotion --
So that was your pudding?
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
...yes I did...?
Yes? I'm trying.
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
If you come to Hawaii --
...I don't know what you mean....
When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
yeah.
This really looks like Hawaii here.
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
This is funny.
Can I come home with you when we get there?
It's ok to ask that.
Right. Alright, lemme call you first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run the numbers, see what's what and I'll give you a call back --
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
Ok, bye, bye.
Why?
I didn't do it.
Hello, how are you?
-- and this is confidential?
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP --
YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
I didn't know you had a sister?
Hi Walter.
Business is very food, thanks. ELIZABETH What's very food?
Hi, Lance.
You should go on a trip.
So what should I do with the pudding?
I have to talk to you in a second about that, Lance, ok?
....I made a call.....  ....and, uh....
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
Well I had to go to Utah...but now I'm here and I'll be right back.
What do you have in the house?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
You can't be late though.
It's....whatever....that's not cool.
Nothing.
Are you sure?
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
Should I call you later?
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think.
"One day, Fanchon was visited by a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting follicles..."
Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!
It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff" --
One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
Honestly! You cut me to the core! What's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when I finally succumb -- when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in your own medicine?
How can one man possibly be so selfish?
If you won't be true to your word, then you've left me no choice.
You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
A man after my own heart...
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
An innocent child is dead.
I know, because I felt it myself --
AND DID YOU?
This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
A few indiscretions in his youth.
What is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche?
Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?
And place my reputation at stake?
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
Of course.
No. It most certainly was not.
What could cause a tincture like this?
A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
Quite.
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
I'll pay you another visit, with a share of the profits, once its sold.
Such gallantry in men is -- sadly -- a rarity; How lucky I am to receive his charity!
Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rou!
Was ever a man more risqu? He wants to take me every way!
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
There's something else I want from you.
Tortures so arcane, so medieval, even I haven't the words to describe them. If you've an ounce of pity in your heart, you'll throw caution aside, and unlock my door...
I don't believe it!
Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
-- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --
Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air...
Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.
I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.
And I in yours.
It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
....shame on you, truly...
You've come to lecture me?
It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
Very much.
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
Houdini mice.
You need to get outta here, Rapunzel
Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master.
Over at RKO?
You know that can't happen.
She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.
There's nothing to explain
Sir? 
Sir?
Good. Retain that feeling. Let it nourish you from this day forth. It shall nourish us both
"You talk about the people as if you owned them. As though they belonged to you. As long as I can remember, you've talked about--"  Orson, I am so goddamn tired--
We're not all hopped up on benzedrine, Orson I Some of us humans need sleep!
Nonsense
I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow
Kid, you just got your ass kicked on Joseph Conrad and now you're gonna go to Schaefer and tell him you wanna do the id and the superego? Stop being so goddamn smart.
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his--
Don't whisper it. Don't even think it
Don't do this
Don't do this
I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!
And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated.
She was . . . innocent
And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
"And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work?"
So they're Jews. . .
What does this have to do with--?
It's too late. The movie's made
Yeah, you're probably right.
Herman.
Thank you-
Get out
Again
CITIZEN KANE There's your title.
I really think you're
Relax, George. It's gonna go great. Trust me. Have I ever lied to you?
Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.
Yeah, I understand, Tommy.
Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
What?
It's not done.
Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
Nothing...
I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
Here's your glove.
Jack! Enough!
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
Yeah, she's nice.
You wasn't with her?
I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to win. I've done a lot of bad things. I dunno...
Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
You want the title shot?
This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right?
What do you mean?
What did Tommy say?
Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...
Where you been?
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy.
Does that mean...
At night?
Oh, Jake.
Who asked you?
I'm not interested in him.
No, I'm not.
What?
I never noticed his face.
All I did...
What's that kissing on the mouth shit?
I am answering...
Yeah --
Why don't you just call him?
I'm leaving you Jake.
Are you drunk?
I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.
Oh. When are they expected home?
I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
Namely?
Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand.
You think I made all this up?
For instance?
I think they missed their chance with her.
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
Who left -- where?
Like what?
Where'd they take Lisa?
Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
Gunnison?
It's me.
Did you get my note?
Why should I?
I don't know what you mean.
I only have a hundred dollars or so.
How?
I'm not ready for marriage.
No.
People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
Uh-huh.
You called the police?
Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it.
Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
Not too active.
Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
You have, perhaps, an ambulance outside?
Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?
You mean leave the magazine?
You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand.
You mean "goodnight."
I have one now.
A lot of things. She's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day.
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
There's nothing to see.
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
Someone not his wife?
He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Who was the trunk addressed to?
I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start?
It could be -- the knife, and the saw.
Too close.
Your name?
Wanna make the colored lights go around and around?
What?
I'm cute, too.
Okay.
No--
I think I should go home.
Hang loose.  We got all night.
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
You make any sandwiches?
Yeah!
That's funny!
I'm not hungry.
Shoot, Jimbo.
You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
Will you wait a minute?
And you can depend on me, son. Trust me.  Whatever comes we'll face it together, I swear.
I think I know my son.
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
Did anyone see you there?  I mean did they get your license number or anything?
What's that pounding?
Open it.
Stay here.  That was my son!
Where's your mother tonight, Plato?
Plato.
No.  I don't think so--
Jim.  What's yours?
I just don't want trouble.
Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
I'm here.  Shut up.
Wowee ow wow!  Let's take it for the summer.
Hey!  How 'bout that!
Who?
You remember that far back?  Boy, I can't even remember yesterday.
Plato!
Your father!
Friends never break promises, do they?  Okay.  Here.  Now listen.  There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe.  You understand that?  They said I could come in and bring you out.
All right, darling.
I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.
Leave me alone.
I don't know why--!
I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.
And they think they are protecting my by moving.
Mess that kid up?
But you don't think that's a solution.
Pretty mixed up?
Where what was.
You going there?
Dig the square wardrobe!
I'm not so bad.
I'm numb.
Neither can I.
Why?
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
I bet you hear everything I say!
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
Are you?
So do you.
He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.
Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
Talk to them!  Heavens!
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
What?
My mother?
You said you'd call my father.
What?
Gabriel -- !
What are you doing here?!
Don't hurt him...
I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play!
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view.  And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
Yes it was all you --
Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!
Your brother...
He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...
What the fuck is going on.
Nick, what are you --
Nick, I love you --
He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
You're in on this.
Jack. Jack Bangs.
For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
They're truck drivers.
All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...
Don't say my name...
I'm almost done.
You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
You shouldn't have.
I'm glad it was me.
You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
Yes!
I never worked at no casino.
A station wagon in Canada.
Christmas... Eve...
We got faith in you, Nick Mason.  You're our inside man.
You'd have to get me inside.  Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.
Why not.
What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
...never... tried...
NO!
I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum
What's the code?
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
'Tis the season, convict.
Leave the tree.
Where is he?! Where is he?!
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
My what?!
Hi, Nick.
I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
It's a roach, guy --
Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.
Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick.
No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
Shoulda written, Rudy...
Alamo...
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
GUARD!!!
No, man! No, no, no!
You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!
YOU TELL HER!
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
Who the hell made this map.
First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?
No. That your head's been up your ass. I walk through the door and Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank god. Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up." And I say "Well, Joe, I coulda told you that." "I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin' toilet! "  I'm not tellin' tales out of school. You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself.
Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.
Bullshit.
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
This better not be some Freddy joke.
It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
You can do some crazy things with it.
What? Snap out of it!
It's a change.
It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
Give me my book.
Sorry, it's my book now.
How many employees?
Don't ask me that.
Mr. Pink.
I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
Lie back down, and try to -
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin' their job.
Fuck all that.
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
Why not?
That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.
Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
Where?
Where? Are they out in the car?
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
I think he's just passed out.
That fuckin did it!
We don't think this place is safe.
Maybe he did.
Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
Like sticking his nose into other people's business.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
It's a long walk back to Aspen.
I suppose it is.
It's too light yet.
If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
I'm sorry.
I can't help how I think. You're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change.
Why?
I haven't got the job yet.
It wouldn't happen to be this...
I don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave.
And meet him there.
Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.
I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
Three men on matched roans?
All right, you didn't know.
Nobody asked you to.
Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
Yeah.
Depends on how good you drive.
They shouldn't have done that.
Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.
That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
Maybe you are. I'm not.
Sounds fine. Only that isn't how it's going to be.
Everybody knows --
Did someone say I wasn't nice?
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
Would they be good to eat?
You were supposed to be reading words.
Steve --
Alex, what are you doing?
Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
Okay... maybe that would be best.
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
He's so brave.
I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back.
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
Shhh!
Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand.
Great!!!
Well... okay... but only as a friend.
There's something I want to share with you too. Here, smell this.
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
What, you think I did this to myself?
Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
Yeah, I broke my fall.
No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.
Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
I don't need your help.
Just wait, you'll see.
We have to destroy him.
I'll go.
Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
Yeah, you feel that? Now put it all together.
That's where my best customers are. Marion Berry, George Bush, the Redskins. I'd like to offer you a job, Cindy. Can you type? Take dictation? Swallow balloons filled with cocaine?
I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.
Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?
I wouldn't go that far.
Who?
How are we going to get them all up there?
Fine.  What's all this stuff?
No, they're just powder burns, thank God. They were empty. Get her upstairs.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
Are you sure it's not the tape?
Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves.
You do.
Just a little Rogaine.
Thanks, handyman.
What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine.  I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.
Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.
Because she will lie?
I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage...
It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??... 
Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom! Better yet, a TV series!
No! Stop it! It's not funny. Mom might do it!  Someone else might die.
Always the dentist.
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Oh Mom...
I'm so happy I could shit.
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
Misty, that's a terrible thing to say!  Detectives, it's time for you to leave. My wife knows nothing about this terrible... accident.
I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess!
Oooohhhh.
You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids!
It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast. 
It was her! Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there!  I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!
No, honey, it's the police.  Hello, officers.
I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
Bon Appetit!
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
You forgot something...
Yes you are.
From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.
We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
Nice one, huh? Winter's coming.  Three dollars?... I guess that's what I marked it...
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
Which room is it?
Yes, I understand.
No.
Yes.
She can only use cash.
For the time being, I imagine that must do.
Hello, Frances.
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
I guess most people are.
Nothing.
No. She asked about the trademark.
Yes.
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
Then you know where Jacqueline is?
Good.
Thank you.. .goodnight.
But you do believe me?
He was a kind little man in his way  and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
But you have treated me that way.
Yes.
We've tried so long to find her.
I don't know.
That you love Mary.
You will die.
Yes.
I have something even better.
I don't think that's so revealing.
I don't know.
I'm at sea, Jason.
Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.
Don't make me tell you, Jason.
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
I understand.
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
I've lost my knack.
Why not let your publisher judge that?
Cloven hoof?
It will be fun meeting Gregory every night at the station.
One believes - it's like any other religion...
I haven't said anything of the sort.
A gay lot - Redi, for instance.  I don't know what her sorrow is,	but her life's an empty one. She's had to have this to cling to. Frances Fallon, with her worship of Jacqueline, has had to follow like a sheep. And Bruns, the fanatic. And you...
A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
Unless what?
No, she's with her sister,
Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
Please.
False alarm.
Television?
No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?
What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
Nine years.
No.
Right, right. I don't feel connected to many people, either. Other than John.
I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
You're in therapy?
Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.
That's correct.  Bit of a dilemma, isn't it?
Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
Can we look at one?
Yes.
I know.
Yes.
Ann, when would I have told you? We were not speaking, if you recall.
Then do it.
When we're making love?
Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
So you have had sex.
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
But I don't understand --
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
I don't know. Possibly.
Not entirely.
Possibly.
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
"Because"? That's not good enough. I asked you a question, Graham. I asked you "how does it feel"? How does it feel, Mr. I Want To Go Down On You But I Can't? Do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? Including me? Come on, how does it feel?
I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
I don't care.
No.
Did you see a message to call me when you got back in?
But I'm not.
I want out of this marriage.
I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.
Not very often.
Yes.
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
Well, do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are? I mean, maybe they do, but I doubt those people are in therapy. Besides, being happy isn't all that great. My figure is always at its best when I'm depressed. The last time I was really happy I put on twenty-five pounds. I thought John was going to have a stroke.
Yeah, I know.
Did you masturbate?
So it was recently that you tried this.
Is he still at your house?
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
Why?
Why, so you can go after him?
Let me talk to him first.
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
Well, why?
Cynthia!
You are in trouble.
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
Thirty-two dollars.
Okay.
Did you take your clothes off?
Wait a minute. Do you mean... don't tell me you... in front of him.
So will you, someday.
She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened.
Why don't you let me tape you?
No.
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?
I can't talk you into it?
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
But I want you to do it, I want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody I can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything.
Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
I did.
Maybe.
Oh.  Well, when, then?
You know what I mean.
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
Graham.
I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
So is my wife, asshole!!
No.
All right, jesus.
Was he nice to you?
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just...  ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...
What do you want to call me at the office for?
Nick, you're so strange...
Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
Used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did.  Cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that.
It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
YOUNG MALE INTERN, TALL AND HANDSOME
Time to check with Flavors.
What's cookin', Bert?
I got it!  I got it!!!
You got it!
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
Who trusts experts?
Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor.  As a matter of fact...
No!  I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here!
I'M LOOKING FOR TRADE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR MOVEMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EMPLOYMENT
Well I hadn't.  I was worried about inherited craziness when they married.  I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'
Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
Who?
What show?
Thanks Officer Park...Vance.
YOUNG BLOOD
Me?
If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
I don't think he intends to go that far.
SIN-I-FUL
Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
No.
We love you, Baby.
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
Huh.
Yeah, I'm here.
So I guess that's it.
Highliner.
Bottle.
If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable.  You boys hungry?
They're just leftovers.
Not so bad yourself.
That's on us.
Well, in that case...
I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
You know how long I've been begging to take you on the wine tour. I was beginning to think it was never going to happen.
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
And Lexapro, yes.
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
I thought you hated Chardonnay.
Let me call Christine.
What color is it supposed to be?
Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
Yeah, that would be a good move.
It's not even a mile.
Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
You know that chick?
You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay?  The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
She works for tips!
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
What?
I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Okay! Fuck!
Count me out.
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
Understanding of what?
That was three years ago after that first party!
Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie.
Obsessively.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
Shut up.
What's happening?
You have to tell me --
Put me down, Jack.
Let's leave it alone.
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
Thanks.
Yeah.
What?
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
Hrnrnrn?
You need a new car anyway.
Why don't you come in?
I know. I love that.
Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
Um... yeah but it's more...
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
So what's happening with your book?
I guess.
Quaffable but far from transcendent.
He had to make a phone call.
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
You golf?
Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
It tastes old.
She doesn't answer me either.
This one?
I don't feel much.
...I will.
Boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A?
Are you going to do this or what?
Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?
That's right.
They already know we're here.
Got it!
I'm close.
We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this.
Oh.
That means they're unemployed.
Bimboo?
You're scaring your sister.
Don't call me Father.
What was the first thing?
Sounds like a virus.
It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
He definitely wasn't a midget.
It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
Pinned? What does that mean?
Yeah.
It's like War of the Worlds.
No money, eh?
Sure.
I'm sorry.
Is he alive?
Yeah... that must have been it.
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
I haven't done anything.
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
I expect.
It never is. But he's my brother.  We're going to California together. But first we're going to stop in Silverado and see our sister. And I can't show up there with a story like this.
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.
We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that.
Is there a place in town that takes... my kind?
Don't press your luck, Carter.
I don't have any family any more.
Rae, I need help.
Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
It is that.
We didn't talk about this.  They took the little boy, Cobb.
The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.
Me too. What's wrong with us?
Give me some of the good stuff.
You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
That was my plan.
He says he doesn't care about anything, but he does. There's just no telling what it's going to be.
Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.
You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
Okay -- for you.
I'm glad we talked.
Difficult.  I'm difficult.
Please.
Almost right.
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
There aren't any.  If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy.  She considers herself an... "instrument".
She'll drive herself.
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
What about it?
I'll walk you out.
Everyone you know is lying.
Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
-- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back.
How can you bring that up at a time like this?
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
Just a minute.
Because obviously she existed, right?
No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky.  How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
... so much like her?
Do what you do to Simone.
I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
How did the wall get there?
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
I was misquoted.
I've seen them all before.
-- a living, breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake.
That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
You do?
You saw that?
This week anyhow.
-- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
I love you too, daddy.
Lainey...
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
This is the story.
Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer.  Look it up.
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.
The background is.
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
Maybe he's talking to himself.
My God, you've got one?
I don't understand.
You're in breach.
Yes, I'd like that.
But that's Simone's part.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
... digitized.
Yes.  Yes, it is.
No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
--Do I know you?
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
You use needles?
Next time I won't be scared of you.
You saw that on T.V., Cole?
That I'm a freak.
Words.
I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
Them?
Yes.
Don't fail me.
Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy.
Yes.
Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
Where will you go, where no one has died?
Really?
Standing next to my window.
Like what?
You talked funny when you went to school here. You talked funny all the way to high school!
S-ssstop that!
S-ssssstop it!
How'd he know I'd come?
Superstition.
Nope.
Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?
You... think... I... stole... your... fancy shoes? I... wouldn't... be... caught... dead in 'em.
Someone actually... employs you?
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
I didn't do anything --
Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
Bus broke down.
Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next.
-- "Billy-Jean" --
It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.
"-- an AXE!"
...Guess it was her time to go. You can't argue... when the good Lord calls you home.
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
Which means we've got ONE week to start acting like a professional band.
Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.
Then why go back now?
Let it go.
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
Look. You want to talk about this?
It's you. You and your father.
You sabotaged the bus! You kept us here... To die! First Keith, then Carl --
It's coming right up. After the third verse.
Us? We been... moonlighting.
Why bother?
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
Oh, yeah?
Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
You took Bill.
A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?
Sorry.
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were --
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
Starla Covington. Don't be ignorant. Everyone knows that. Fucking prom queen.
What?
Brought you munchies.
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
My present?
We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
You know how rumors start.
Absolutely not. In fact, I picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer.
Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
Eleven.
I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
I would've come back for you.
Yeah.
You want to lose this putz or not?!?
Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'.
No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
You take the front, I'll take the back.
Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'.
How'd you know?
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
I don't know, man. Ask him?
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
But I still don't think...
Redneck heaven.
Can a pig whistle?
Yeah, guy?
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye.
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
Anything else you don't want me to know?
I'm cucumber cool.
Seventy-two five.  Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it.
You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.
Then it must be a helluva idea.
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
Of course. Yes.
That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait.
Yeah.
Ww... uh...
You woulda?
Damn... alright then.
I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry.
I'm not doing cocaine.
Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry.
The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally.
Then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand.
I got his machine.
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
Only if you really, truly mean it.
GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
-- this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough --
They what? What? No. No. Why?
-- Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing... The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the million dollar contract on Israel very real.
Israel's legal representation, the firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of Israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas... that can't happen.  We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe.  It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi, Fratiano, Gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra, than Buddy Israel.
What are you doing here?
-- You can and you will.
Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we --
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.
...So you made another deal?
-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
No... It's not.  What it lacks... is an end.
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
That's the punchline, y'ready?
Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
Security's locking down the elevators.
Hold up, hold up, I'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen...
I can trust Rheya.
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
Yes.
How quickly?
What?
He'll let me in.
My wife.
I wish you'd told me.
Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
Yes.
I love her.
Why?
I'll be right back.
My Thomas is a little rusty.
Let's go home.
I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
What do you mean?
I know.  I know.  We don't have to talk about that.
You don't know?
It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
I think so.
Well.  He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.
That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya died.  Killed herself.  I'm different.
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching.
I'm disgusting.
Then you'll die.
Neither did I.
Yes, you are --
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
Shhhh.  Just stay with me.  Stay with me.  Everything is forgiven. Everything.
Why do you say that?
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
Sooner, the better.
Big talk... Desperate guy.
I can't open it.
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
Okay, then let's make it easy.  It was a mistake.  Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it.
Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular "marching band".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
Yeah.
... Don't explain.
I think it's probably still a good idea.
You take care.
Sure we are, let's go!
Your what...?
What are you talking about?
Get in bed.
'Til they pick up the perp.  Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.
Well, actually, she looks better than that.
Oh, some shit.
Why?
I think -- she's crazy.
I'll be right up.
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
Me neither.
I just sat and listened.
If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.
It should've been me...
Koontz!  I need you guys!
No, I need'm now!
Yeah!  Seniority gets the day shift.
Does it make you... hard?
Erect.  You know, a "boner?"  I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man.
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
We're gonna pass the street.
So, what are you doing tonight?
Peter Parker, you have no idea what I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.
Let me see.
You stop him?
Nonot really.
No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
Don't be pitiful.
Mm-hmm.
Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
Hmf-hrr?
Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.
Thanks, I already ate.
Just about.  See, I also have this amazing strength.
Thank God.
What's your problem?
Strong...
Hm.  Well, I like you, too.  I like your aunt.  I like your shoelaces. I like--
So you've found Thorkel?
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--
Let's talk in the hall.
I've had an extremely bad day, Octavius.  A sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures.
I don't care.  Cretin.
I don't think I'll be running into him.
Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but--
Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
Like it?
What?
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
Forgive me if I don't feel too sympathetic right now.
Bonkers.
No, no!  Not there!
They may. That's why I would keep my mouth shut.
Plenty.
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
I don't have to think. We didn't tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
Looks good outside.
You stink, Sefton!
Take it.
Why not?
Okay, Security -- what happened?
Yeah.
What are the chances busting out of here?
What is your number?
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
What exactly is he charged with?
He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
Perfectly all right. I do not like boots.
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
Maybe they were layin' for 'em out there!
Let go, Animal! It's roll call! Hitler wants to see you!
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya -- Otchi Tchorniya!
Hey -- Comrade! Over here! This is Harry Shapiro -- the Volga Boatman of Barrack four!
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
What's the award?
No?
Where'd that come from?
It's beautiful!  You goin' to eat it all yourself?
Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
This is a good one!  Shut up, everybody! Listen to this!  'The President of the United States to Harry Shapiro. Greeting: Having submitted yourself to a local board, you are hereby notified to report...' What do you know! So now I'm a draft evader!
Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them keys.
Hey, here's Esther Williams.
I'll open mine, too.
Let me alone.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
I want everybody out of here. We'll need a lot of commotion on the compound.
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
Yeah? How would you like to see the guts of nine pals splattered all over your plane?  C'mon Joey -- don't be afraid.
The one you are hiding in the barrack, don't you know? The one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound.
A little weak today.
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
I called it the last time, didn't I?
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.
Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
Six o'clock in Berlin. They were having lunch in Cleveland.  Am I boring you, boys?
The one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.
Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.
All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
Not particularly.
Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other.
Look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?
What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
Where is he?
I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
I believe so.
I have to find a way to get to Soran.
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
I'll go. You have the Bridge.
You're in the Nexus.
Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.
Please, please.
She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
That's right.
You could say that.
I always do.
Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
No, I didn't know that.
I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now.
Make it so.
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
They're just trying to decide whether a twenty year-old Klingon Bird of Prey is any match for the Federation flagship.
You may still. Somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.
Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.
The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
The thought had crossed my mind.
Not if it means killing over two hundred million people.  I wonder, did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?
Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.
Aye, sir.
The star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes.
Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?
Aye, sir.
All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
What did you see, Chekov?
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!
... Fascinating.
We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!
Spock's burial robe.
That may be difficult...
Not exactly.
My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
"... If the Captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger." I know the book, Saavik.
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
They've knocked out the damn automation center.  I've got no control over anything!
Saavik... Is... David with you?
He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.
Much is at stake...
You would have done the same for me.
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
Best speed to Vulcan. Mr. Chekov, take the prisoners below.
It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs...
Oh, I'll have "Mr. Adventure" eating out of my hand. And I'll see you at the rendezvous.  All my hopes.
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
Report status!
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
... Yes...
... The needs of the few...
Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
But sir! Federation Starship approaching.
I trust my instincts.  Admiral Kirk. This is your opponent speaking.
Put him on screen!  Study him well.
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
Good for you, Lieutenant.
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.' Happy Birthday...
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
Takes the stuff a while to ferment. Gimme.
As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.
He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.
How can you think of food at a time like this?
It's like the Garden of Eden...
I'm taking this bunch to sick bay.
Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
I have my orders.
Carol!
Is that a poem?
I know, I know...
Maybe...
That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
I don't know.
It's not much different from Enterprise.  When I was a guest aboard her some years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals. And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review: You say you have no details of Project 'Genesis' ?
Of course. We're one big happy fleet. Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?  It is very cold in space.
We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!
Inoperative.
I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.
Chekov, who is this man?
Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
A few shots, sir.
Picture, Mr. Saavik.
Scotty, let's have it.
Give the word, Admiral.
Aye, sir.
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
Yes, SIR.
The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.
That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
The tape was made a year ago. I can only assume they've reached Phase Two by now --
It would explain a great many things --
Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
It's all we've got.
... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
Or the one.
Yes, sir.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
Energize defense fields.
Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all people go by the book. Hello, Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus...
'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
They just don't want us going in there.
At what.
Understood, sir.
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
Trying, sir!
Battle stations.
Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
Yeah.
Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
Mr. Sulu... Take us home...
We've done it before.
-- That's the general idea.
Come on, Pavel...
... My shoes...
Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
Hamlet, Act I scene 4.
Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.
We're just -- observing.
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
Yes, under "U.S. Government." Now we need directions.
Depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor.
Like what?
All right. Let's take it from the top.
No, <u>my</u> name.
I'm wery sorry, but --
Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
We are launching everything we have.
I suppose they told you that...?
Is there something wrong with the one I have?
How soon?
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
Go ahead.
Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
It's his way.
Implicitly.
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
You want the details?
Noon tomorrow...?!
You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?
But Kirk...
Kirk. They're gone.
A spaceship with a missing man.
Calm yourself, Nurse.  Scotty, get us out of here!
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
... You have a point...
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
What is our target in time?
Yes.
Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.
I see.
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
Go, Mr. Sulu.
Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
On speakers.
Right.  Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.
Nothing... I should never have left him...
On screen.
Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
Two?
Mr. Sulu?
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
Tell her I feel fine...
Arigato. Sayonara.  Thank you, honorable sir.
This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
There are caves in those mountains.
Roughly translated: puberty... although for a Klingon that's not doing it justice...  Any severe mood swings, unusual aggressive tendencies -- be sure to let me know right away...
I thought it might begin the healing process.
I'll be here.
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
Sometimes I do.
Bye.
Very good, Doctor. Picard out.
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
How about a passive radiation scan?
What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...
Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
Will the structure hold if we blast through?
Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
Sir, Commander Worf and I have been working on several tactical plans to safely...
A planet in Federation space...
The Ba'ku.
There's nothing further to be gained from this...
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
Do you know how to disable the injector?
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
They... are in opposite directions, sir...
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
Fail-safe?
It's nothing. I'm just tired.
... had regenerated.
I'll be in Engineering.
Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.
If it works you mean.
Why not?
Eject the core.
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
Remind me to lodge a protest...
... so they need us to put out one more brush fire.  Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?
So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
Beam him out!
Prepare to enter the atmosphere... we'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him...
No, sir. It is a gorch.
No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.
Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf.
You should feel right at home with them.
No children?
But it's comfortable.
Or you could try lying down.
On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does.
And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
Absolutely.
Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why the hell are we --
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
Vulcan?
I believe so.
What?
Where's the Sphere?
I am the Borg.
I will admit... there are times when I wish I had an emotion chip I could turn on and off.
Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
I told you, there's no --
They used copper pipes in their plumbing... so I melted it down... and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings.  It's not the strongest alloy... but it's better than all this crude aluminum and steel.
Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
Don't flatter yourself. I take pictures of a lot of junk.
We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
No. It's a lot further than that.
We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
Steady as she goes.
Onscreen.
Yes, sir.
Unless you'd like to stay.
What?
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
Agreed. Options?
Right.
Understood!
Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols...
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
I didn't mean this future.
We were until your torpedoes!
Ah. I believe you also consumed Romulan ale at the officers' mess on the night of question, Doctor?
You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
I have on occasion disobeyed orders.
Your honors, the State rests.
First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.
Aye, sir; thrusters...
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
Mr. Valtane, any more data?
Is that wise, sir? I mean, given their situation -  Aye, sir.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
Good enough for one - two would look suspicious... killed while attempting escape... now that's convincing for both.
WHO ELSE...?
Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman -  ... so I volunteered.
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
Sir?
You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
Congratulations, Lieutenant. That must make you very proud...
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
So, that's it..
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
Who else?
Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
We are experiencing a technical malfunction. All backup systems inoperative.
You having hearing problems, mister?
Visual!
What's left of it.
Nevertheless.
Then someone forged a data bank entry.
He's placing himself in a most awkward position...
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.
Maybe we should write them a letter?
I was taken from my homeworld by people called the "PakJeds." They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the "Bolians." The "Bolians" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship...
Yes, please continue.
Because you are dangerous.
No.
No. Can I move now?
For how long?
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
He turned out all right.
Not tonight, I have work here.
Yes. And, frankly, I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer...
Now, you make a toast.
Good work. The download?
It would appear so.
They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and...
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
Of you?
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
Why is it moving?
With pleasure, Captain.
You're speaking of emotional investment?
And I you.
Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
Make it so.
Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic.  To leave all of this behind and be with me.
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
He wants to look me in the eye.
Sir?
Ready, sir!
On screen.
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
That will never happen.
Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. We can wait.
We can only hope so.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
She's the most beautiful ship Ive ever seen.
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
And the Senate supports you?
I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. 
What's this all about?
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
We are.
Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
Do as I tell you!
A matter of hours now.
I came this far alone ...
You don't have to understand.
Praetor.

I don't think so... 
Thank you.
I make maps.
No.
It is beautiful.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Stay right there...
Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
Shermin...
Washington thinks it's too late for that.
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
Marc Shermin.
Which way do you want to go?
What.
Dashboard.
Money.
Yes.
You're full of tricks, aren't you?
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
Oh God! You're going to get us both killed. Okay... in your pocket...
You. Mouth closed.
No.
You want to try it?
This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
Shit!
Music.
You better.
My...  ...car will take me...  ...up there... home.
Yes.
I need you.
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
I do not speak English.
You keep this. Now this is hitch- hike...  You stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? And you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. When you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this...
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship.
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on.
Come on.
I can't stay on this planet.
You promised you would get me to my ship.
You promised.
You're damn right I am.
I gave you a baby last night.
But...
What for?
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
I must go.
Call the police!!
Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on.
He doesn't understand... just walk away...
My grandmother's rich.
Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
Doesn't make sense.
Very beautiful country up here...
Wait'll you see it.
It was a man though... right?
It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
No.
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
What's all this squid shit?
No problem.
Leave him alone, Tran.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.
My God.
Watch and see.
I just got to talk to you for one second.
I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
What?  He gonna record you on his label?
Damn right.
Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
Tell me.
We should talk alone.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
That's right.  Clips.  Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here.  This isn't like TV only better.  This is life.  It's a piece of somebody's life.  Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex.  You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it.
You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--
So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
W'sup, Max?
Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
What do you mean?
That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?
Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
I need to see more... get more detail.  Something.  I feel his presence, so strong...
It's not your fault.
Now you're really getting paranoid.
This tie doesn't go with blue!
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
Why?
I'm not going.
Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
Are you going to make me beg?
This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
Winona.
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
You must travel a lot, huh?
Not bad, huh?
I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
He had an orange hat on.
It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
You're as crazy as he is! He's right! You don't give a damn about saving lives at all! Fuck you!
You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.
Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.
This is some serious shit.
My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
Does Koessler ask about me?
Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
Not the way I can.
What's up?
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
And you're working with him?
Does one exist?
I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it.  Don't worry, I've cleared it.
Yeah, of course.
Low calls him Suspect Zero.
That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
I...
I'll be back.
Yes, sir.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
He's moved on to TV.
Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you, I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off, think things through.  Where's the file?
Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel.
Whatever happened to MyDick?
Something came up, Murman, my man.
Lead the way, Murman.
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
[Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]
[What does the file say?]
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
Yes, sir.
I talked to him.
Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway.
It's over for you.
Shit.
You're right. I know.
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
Shuddup.
Shut up.
You're money, baby.
What do you drive?
...maybe...
I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
You better pay the man.
Hi.
Yes. Like the quiche.
Tell me about it...
What what? What advantages?
Anything.
What else is going on?
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
What an asshole.
Did you get it?
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
I'm a comedian.
Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
Six years.
When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
...It's really getting late.
Yeah?
Right.
I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
Oh no?
Well, until now. Tend the pin.
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
Bud.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
Go for it, man.
Oh boy.
Well, that's dumb.
Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. You'll get over it.
Sometimes is still hurts. You know how it is, man. I mean, each day you think about it less and less. And then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. It's kinda weird. You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. And the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile.
So, what? Eleven?
Not well.
What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
What are they doing here?
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike again. Could you just call me when you get in? I'll be up for awhile, and I'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all... 
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
Vegas!
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money.
What are you talking about? Look at all the honeys.
Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
Well, you look money, baby. We both look money.
You think they're watching?
What?!?
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
Yea, how much?
It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.
Why? So you can beat yourself up? Sitting around in that stuffy apartment. It's just plain bad for you, man. It's depressing. You've come so far. Remember the first week? After she told you? You couldn't even eat.
See? And what does this guy she's with do?
Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off.
A day.
Yeah. I guess you could call it that.
What an asshole. Didn't you see "Boys in the Hood"? Now one of us is gonna get shot.
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
Chelios to Roenick...!
...How novel.
...double diamond...
...Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey.
...it's definitely on.
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
You don't have to wait three days...
Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
I want you to use all your powers, all your skill, as you love me.  I do not want his mother to see him as he is.
Your girl friend.  She says she can't make it tonight.  You lousy bastard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number. I'll kill you, you bastard!
Like hell I will.
Yeah.
No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
Sure.
It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
It's been two years.  He's probably in trouble again.
You wanted me to be your son.
A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
Yes.
You want him to stay in this country.
How do you know I come from America?
Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
Yes.
Okay.  One minute.
No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
We're all tired...
Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
Can you do it Mike?
Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
An accident.  No one was hurt.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
Thanks Tom.
No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.
Yes.  Tell me.
Michael...
Michael you're trying to scare me...
Michael, I love you.
He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
No, I would not like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman.
When will I see you again?
Don't you want dinner first?
I'm busy.
All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
You've read about my father in the papers.  You've seen that no one's here to guard him.  Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him.  Believe me and help me.
To the city.
I do renounce him.
Just be patient.
The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone family wants to buy you out.
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink.
I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
Is that good?
Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
Did you speak to my father?
It's vile.
Okay, darling.
I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive.
Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
What? What's this?
Marge! You've got to hear this!
No, I think your mother, her illness --
I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I --
Your parents met her.
I played piano in a few places.
He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
What club?
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
I thought you'd missed the train.
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
So tell me.
Oh God, I don't think so.
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
What evening?
I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies...
Sure.
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
Have you done something to your hair?
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?
Bird. That's jazz.
He's not a man, he's a god.
I absolutely agree with Marge.
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie.  Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.
He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
He's having an early night.
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
I can explain.
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
Shut up! Shut up!
That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels.
Emily.  Just kidding.
As in the...?
What?
How did you know that?
Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
Hello Meredith.
I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
I can't later.
A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.
Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
I'm fine.
Was who Meredith?
You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things.
Of course. What happened to your face?
November, I thought.
No. Here is a pattern. Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead -- he leaves your apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks, and the owner tells the Police it was stolen on November 7th. We look at hotel records and we see oh! Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then our boatman remembers two Americans taking a boat.
Let her in, what's the difference? Let her in.  No, actually, no, I'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later.
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiance?
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
Huh?
Huh?
He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
It keeps ya busy.
What?
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them.
What's wrong?
Thank you, Travis.
Yeah.
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
Have you been noticing anything strange?
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.
I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
With the other hand, right?
That's a dollar forty-seven.
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
No.
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.
Easy.
Iris.
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
Where is home?
Pittsburgh.
I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.
You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them.
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
Why, thank you Travis.
Thank you, sir. You're a good man, sir.
I know. I tried that.
Listen, son, you gonna get smart, you can leave right now.
Age?
Oh?
Your name Sport?
Iris?
Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
Hey Wizard.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
I know.
Travis, look, I dig it. Let me explain. You choose a certain way of life. You live it. It becomes what you are. I've been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night. Still don't own my own cab. I guess that's the way I want it.  You see, that must be what I am.
Thanks.
You know how I feel about what you do.
What do you have, a FUCKING WATER PISTOL?  Get him back!
No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons.  What the fuck do you think?
Wrong.
I'm not the chemical weapons expert.
I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
Partners.
What's that?  Mason?
I am, too.
I wish you were coming with me.
Damn...
Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
Well...
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
I'm  fine.  Really.  
Oh.
Have you got a cigarette?
Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke.
No... I can't... I have to... I can't...
Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?
I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou.  There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...
Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
When did I leave?
Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but they really couldn't help much. Broke their hearts when we closed up.  Broke mine, too.  But now that you're back, well, things will be different around here, that's for sure.  C'mon, I'll show you where we live.
Who... are they?
... Ernie.
Oh, hi Cue... Carl.  Sorry.
... what?
Sandra Sinclair.
Then I'll call you a cab.
Aren't you coming?
Can we get him to the hospital?
Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here.
Hey, it's the best way to tell.
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
Huh?  Oh, sure.  Just pull the door shut when you leave.
I was decorated.
I'm not sorry for what I said.
Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
When was that?
What?
Yeah.  I hope you don't mind.  I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry.  And me.
Yeah... me too.
I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy.  But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help.
I'll have to think about this.  I have to get back... I should go...
Actually, my grandpap.  But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it?  Here.
Yes.  Very.
No.  Absolutely not.
Yes?
It's a lovely garden.
No. Just a few hours.
I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
All right. 
It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
I despise it.
When was this?
Different?
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
You get straight to the point, don't you?
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
Then go.
It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
Cathy!
They're birds!
Well, I suppose...
Oh, I suppose so.
I don't think your mother would like that.
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
Is she all right?
Shhh. Shhhhh.
It's Alice.
Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
Shall I call the doctor?
Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
...get away without thanking you in some small way. After all, you haven't even met Cathy and you are staying for the weekend...
Yes.
I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
I know exactly what I want, Mother.
Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.
I'm sorry, Mitch.
I started to say... inside...
No, not exactly.
What?
Annie's there. She'll be all right.
Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is these things happen sometimes, you know? Ain't much we can do about it. 
Yes.
Monday?
I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
The sign says strawberry finches.
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
How can you tell?
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam. 
Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut.
That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
Criminal.
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...
You are, aren't you?
How does Mother know what I like to do?
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
I wrote the letter.
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
Why?
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
What?
No, I have my things in the car.
It's an uprising.
Certainly, of birds.
Hear!
I'm frightened, Mitch.
Don't let's take any chances.
It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
Mitch...
No... wait.  Hold me.
We'll take it slow until we get to the main road.  Are you ready?
You said three o'clock.
Yes.
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
No one called it a war!
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
Of course it does. If we believe that birds are attacking, why... why next we'll believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of...
Put on your coats! Do you want to get trapped here?
Can't you please finish your drink?
Ma'am, is you'll allow me, I'd like to give you cause for courage -- Dr. MacFarlane is a great man -- I think he's the greatest man in medicine.  God would not have given him such gifts if they were not meant for Georgina's cure.
It is a pity.
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
MacFarlane
Where can I find him?
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
Come -- it's a chance to try out your bedside manner, Fettes.  Take a look at the child.
Excuse me.
Now you run off and see that pretty Mrs. Marsh and explain to her.
This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
I am sure.  I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again.
He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
That's the way of it, Fettes.  You bring the lassie to me.
I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
What?
A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
They'll be thinking of that, too.
The white horse.  The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.
One shouldn't get used to the wrong things, Georgina.  You want to walk and run and play.
I can't.
A doctor?
I am the best man for the job.
That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
I've ordered nothing from you.
Get out of here!
So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
Give me money or I'll tell the police you murder the "subjects."
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
Aye --
Yeah. I sure will.
We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
Where the fuck did you come from?
They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
Good thing in a situation like this.
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
Nobody.
I know her friends.
I told you, I knew your sister.
Yeah, I know.
I don't want to see!
Yeah, we do.
I know the guy leaves a sign.
The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that.
Not tonight. Honest.
Just hold on to me.
This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
What's that supposed to mean? He was right here. He was!
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
He said he'd prove it.
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
I don't believe you.
If you mean that you are afraid of us--
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
Why not, Bobby?
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
Just Klaatu.
Sit down, Mr. Harley.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
Thank you... Have you any news?
I can judge only by what I see.
Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.
There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.
The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents--
I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
Goodnight, my dear.
I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
He'll have you -- and Tom.
He'll catch on to it in no time now.
I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
Can't stand light?
Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?
Zero.
They're gonna book us.
That's just the way we like it.
If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
What?
What happens in tow and a half hours?
You have a T.V.?
Whatcha doin' over here?
I better get cleaned up, then.
Who, Laddie?
No, Laddie.  It was a <u>memory</u>.
He's just a deep sleeper.
No.  I'm up.
Can't.  Got plans of my own.
Gotta go, Mom.
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
I thought we were poor.
Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?
We can't talk about it on the phone.
Sorry, Mom.  It was a mistake. I thought I saw something out the window.  I was reading this horror comic and I guess I go a little carried away...
C'mere, Nanook.
Must be a circuit breaker.
But, Mom...
-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
I hope so.
I thought you said they needed discipline?
What do you mean?
Michael's great.  I like Michael.
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
I was here first.
Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
Piss off.
Don't turn on the light.
Nanook...
Nothing!  I didn't hurt him.  <u>He</u> bit <u>me</u>!  This is <u>my</u> blood!
Huh?...
Let's load 'em.
No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
Finish what?
Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
Don't walk behind me.
If it did get to him.
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
No.  Just let him freeze out there.
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
You buy any of this, Blair?
But...
We got morphine, don't we.
... Where is everybody?!  I'm half frostbit!
You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are!
Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
Then we'll never make it.
After all this mess.
You reach anybody yet?
Well, stick to it.
Well, stick with it.  I want you at it round the clock.  We got to get help in here...
What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers!
Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma...  ... we'll do you last...
One thousand volts.  Should be enough.
What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots?
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
I'm sure a lot of you already know.
What for?
So what do you make of it?
The journey is part of my work.
And everyone looks like us?
What else can they do?
What happened?
What?
It frightens you.
It was meant to.
Yes.
Yes.  But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again.
No...
I won't leave you like this.
Alexander.
You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
Created?
How?
They survived above.  Became what they are.
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
Because the past is immutable. Frozen.  Dead... And you are the past.
Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
No...
I know.
I just love mechanical things.
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
I -- what are you?!
No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!
Why is it -- breaking up?
Got here as soon as I could.
Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
Not like this.  Never like this. Emma, I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing, it's that moments like this are rare.  And I will thank God for them every moment of every day.
It's only a machine.
Do you know you were humming?
What?
How romantic...
You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
I would.
Good night, Alex.
I'm glad.
His home.
Sir...?
Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really.  It's rather hard to explain.
Mm.
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
You can see so many here.
Thank you.
What you need is an engineer.  If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily.
How do you decide?
It's undamaged?
So you can use it now?
My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
We don't know.
Dean Fulton...
You supported his application, Dr. Philby.  You are his senior, advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.
Kalen...
I am.  Are you a climber?
I'm glad he's gone.  Maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy.
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
Depends on what you're seeing.
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
My business?
And what does that mean?
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket.
That's too bad.
They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for.
Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.
Sure.
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
Mom, he just fixed our car.
[Beat] What?
[Beat] What?
Yeah.
Yes.
No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
I don't know.
Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we?
Good. How's your mom?
That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
No. The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. Not my mind.
Why?
Why would we do that?
Well, what time is it?
It doesn't look all that different.
Maybe.
How...how do you know?
You still don't believe me, do you?
Listen to me. That's all I ask.
Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.
No.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.
You remember it?
What?!
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
In the leg.
Umm, yes.  She was driving.
Tell us about him.
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
What's wrong?
What for?
Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.
It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most of the time I just let it slide.
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
You're a little angle, you are.
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
Are you in town?  This sounds long distance.
What the fuck is going on?
Christ, sure... yes!
Not yet.
Call me back.
I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?
No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
Who is it?
I don't know.  It doesn't even matter anymore.  I just want you to be happy... It's not that I don't love you either.  But Jimmy, your timing couldn't be worse.
Oh yeah.
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
Okay.  I will, too.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway.
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
Well, I've had it up to my ass with sedate!  You said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. Well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun.
Just what is that supposed to mean?
My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people.
Don't you fall apart on me. Goddamnit, Thelma.  Every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time... Not this time. Everything's changed now... Now you can do whatever you want, but I'm going to Mexico.  I'm going.  Are you coming with me?
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about this!  Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will!  You understand?
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?
They think we like it.  Maybe they think it turns us on.
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
Alright, Louise!
Just past Boise City.
You know those little dogs you see people with?
I can see that.
Well, you got it now.
Nothing.  It's not funny.
Just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
Thelma!
I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
About how fast was I going?
I swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this.  But if you ever met my husband, you'd know why I just can... You wanna step out of the car, please?  You wanna put your hands on your head, please?  Louise, shoot the radio.
Hit it.
It's good.  It's what the pioneers ate.
Are you alright?
Yes, Thelma?
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
Well, let me know when you figure it out.
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
You're drivin'.
About two hundred and fifty miles.
What?!
I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
How do you stay so positive?
We're not giving up, Thelma.
What are you talkin' about?
You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
Say you're sorry.
Hi there!  You alright?
So you admit it?
Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?
You sent that?
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
Hey, look on the bright side --
Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away.
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
Uh-huh.
Yeah feels like it.
Hm?
Jesus Christ you're right.
You stole her from me. Now I want her back.
Who?
From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas.
Who?
No, thanks.  Love a little bundt cake if you have some!
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
A girl after your own heart, Ted.
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
Pat Healy.
It's right there on your golf bag.
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?
You're a movie buff?
A fucking moron.
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
Huh... that's strange.
Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're not going to believe this -- well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to -- but I just got beeped for emergency surgery. Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to bail on you.
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
No.
You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.
No, not at all.
She's in a wheelchair?!
I said buttplug. She's heinous.
You're a sick man, you know that?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
You mean him.
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
You were following us?
Hm?
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
He's no Steve Young.
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.
Healy.
Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
Tucker, you look different some how. Did you do something with your hair?
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
No, it's an old football injury.
Huh?
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
Oh yeah.
Really? I never got a message.
No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
Thanks.
Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.
No short game.
What are you?
Yeah?
Trying to be.
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
All right, let's go.
Then what the fuck did you do it for?
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
What?! No please, sir --
Oh.  Oh, that's a good one.
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
What are you doing?
Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary. The navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones.
Yes.
Tomorrow...
Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. The invasion would succeed. Castro would be gone. Just like that. Easy.
What if I can't?
Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
We've got bigger problems right now.
That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?
It's too politicized with you in there, anyway. They need to be able to stick their necks out.
He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
You can't take him out this late in the game.
So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
I think it's a bad idea.
Yes it is.
Time is of the essence.
Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.
Kids are supposed to get detention.
I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.
I'll be evacuated with the President.
He was.
No you weren't.
Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day.
In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there.
I know, I know...
Maybe it's harder for them to say it than they let on. At the very least, they believe it's in our best interest. And at the end of the day, they may end up being right.
I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
Okay, Ken. We're going.
Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
I'm afraid not, Mr. President. The sub has positioned itself between the Pierce and the Soviet ships. Admiral Anderson insists it's too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters. The Pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub.
Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.
Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
FBI? What you investigatin'?
-- don't "man" me, Jimmy. Where's the key?
What journey?
-- did you understand me when I said that --
Ray.
We'll have to give Leo a refund. Because he's gotta go to the M.E. In case you don't know, Officer, violation of the Major Crimes Act on --
How'd you know?
She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. His parents were killed in a car wreck.
We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
After we've completed our investigation.
You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
Good question. Hardly sees anybody anymore. Hasn't left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some tobacco?
He knows me?
Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.
He said he doesn't know.
What'd you expect to hear?
What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
What are you talking about?
And I don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you.
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.
Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.
You bought her some time, Kola. Ain't never gonna be over... but you bought her some time.
Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
No. No, no. Thank you.
At Sioux Falls Pen?
What's with you people? Why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? I came through, man.
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth.
Red Deer Table! What's with you, man?
It's not that.
What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
I saw one.
You let me make a fool of myself.
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
What plane.
I don't enjoy watching things suffer.
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
In that order?
What?
He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
Do what, show you a good time?
What?
That's what I want.
That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round!
Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.
Yes sir.
Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
He better be kidding!
You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be where your head used to be.
280, 290, 300 knots.
Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We did it...Damn! We sure did it!
Any more MiGs?
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
Pay no attention to it. They're just trying to rattle you. It's all psychological. Sit down..and drink.
Bogey at three o'clock high! Nose on!
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
I want him!
Wood's okay. I want Viper.
What'd you do?
Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky.
GOT 'EM.
LOOK OUT!
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
Nope.
Tell me one thing.
NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR WINGMAN. NICE GOING.
It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
So have I.
Three guesses.
No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
Yes sir.
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
Yes sir.
Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
Then why are you here?
Oh, you mean the thrill!
No bother.
You think I should quit?!
I'm nothing like him.
I never heard that.
It's not true.
I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.
Over there man.
What was that?  An accident?
Take me to the hotel.
Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!
The Last Resort!  Quick!
But maybe you can change all that.
Hey, I got four kids to feed.
They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.
Thank you.
He's lying.  Hauser turned against you.
I am Quaid.
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
Why not?
Come on...put his head in place.
Don't you keep up with the news?  We're doing alien artifacts now.
Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars.
Hetero.
Sleazy...and demure.
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
Any news of Quaid?
O.K., everybody pull out!
Relax, you'll live longer.
You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
You tell me.
Rekall?
Oh, Rekall.
Come on, let's go have that drink.
Up to the right.
Up!
What the hell is this?
The brunette.  The one you told me about.
Nobody.
Bye.
Doug...
I'm honored.
I'm here at Rekall.
Nice to meet you.
Whatever you say...Just answer one question.  What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
You.  You're the same.  No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you.  Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an "Ego Trip".
Hauser left me a note.
I didn't lose it.  Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else.  Me.
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
I used to model for 'em, why?
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
The one in the mine!
Aliens built it.
What?
Some kind of mutation...?
One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
No problem.
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
Cannon fuse.
Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.
We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece!
Well, who put you two in charge?
No good.  You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail.
No.  We go straight.
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
Car wash?!  That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!
Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.
Damn straight!  Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing!
Adios, bridge!
He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.
Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.  Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.
Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
Fifteen lousy bucks.
Yeah.  Where's your truck?
Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
Right.
Like hell you are.
Jesus, Val, it's pretty far.
Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...
Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
What?
She wants to lay down.  I'm a little worried.
Around here?  Why would they?
It does.
You guys do all the odd jobs.
Like <u>what</u>?!  There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!
LET'S DO IT!
An hour after you picked it up!
Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live.
It most certainly is.
Where's the nearest hospital?
I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.
Let's snuff this lowlife!
Not necessarily...
I can describe it.
I didn't take my eyes off it!
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
I specialize, Roger...
I'm not a kid anymore, I can't be all over the map --
-- The Nazi he knifed?
Saving it for the Sunday Times.
-- You found his mugshot?
I feel much better now.
A spinal injury, in the line of duty. It was in Kitty's report...
1530 Rivington Street.
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
But what?
I've seen this picture before.
...For ten years, now.
-- Me? Neither.
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
You don't drink "booze".
Eddie, if I wanted to make love with you again, I'd do it sober.
Screw you too, Kitty.
That's right.
"Painted"?
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
By trusting me. Shit, man...
Don Reynard.
Shu Kai Kim.
What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
I never joke about waiving a client's Sixth Amendment right to trial.
You know you're very tense, Mr. Reynard. Y'oughta take a week off, fly the wife and kids to Oahu.
Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
That's right.
I would tend to plead the Fifth.
...A soldado, he takes care of it.
Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
I want you to kill for me.
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
You're lucky I am not wasting you.
That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
Thank you, Carl.
An old woman and her grandson.
Chalfont. Weird. Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. Two Chalfonts.
Yep, it sure is.
Did she have someone with her?
Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
Smell something fishy, huh?
Right, Gordon. We'll be in touch.
COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.
What?
No, sir, we did not.
How come Jack let's you work here?
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
Sure, but let's finish up with this first.
I think that's a good idea.
In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
You didn't do your homework?
I don't know what to do.
Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever.
No, I want to smoke.
Donna, you are a muffin.
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "E" starin' at me.
Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
I haven't got it yet.
Maybe.
No... No...
But you're strong Laura... so much stronger than I... How can I help you? I can't. I can't even go outside.
He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
James...
Not now.
I can't tonight.
What?
Hiking?
That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
I understand.
What were you doing in my room?
Mom, take it easy.
Fine.
Not really.
Yes.
Oh, Leland.
Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.
How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
Nothing, I chickened out.
Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
There's no one here.
Yes.
Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
Yes.
How did you settle on the amount?
You thought it was just.
That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money.  I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.  I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.  I can't do it. I can't take it.
...yes. Get her on the phone...
It's a crime.
I wouldn't do it.
Yes.
I... yes.
No.
I'm just an M.D.
I know of him.
'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
...We did everything we could...
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
No, you did fine.
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
No. No. Thank you. You go home.
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
My client can't walk, your Honor.
I don't have a week. This case never should have come to trial. You know better. You're Mr. Independent. You want to be independent? Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
Ready, your Honor.
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
What?
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
And what are you? A cop?
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
And is that what you're going to do?  Is that what you're going to do...?
I've got to work.
And what makes you so tough?
If I don't 'grow up...'
It's over!
What is that to you...?
I have to talk to you.
I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number?
I understand. Thank you, my name is Galvin. I'll be at the following number in a half an hour. It's urgent.
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
Nothing happened.
I didn't do it, Mister.
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
Yes. Yes, I have.
We, yes. Yes. They, they present their side, and I get the same chance. To cross-examine... to... to...
Yes.
...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?' 'That's correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you been in this bar ?' Pat says, 'No, but my sister has...'  Everyone. Buy yourself one too.
...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...
We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
Oh shit, what's today?
Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
Yeah.
You use their witness.
I think we tried that. The case is over.
...you need some old forms that she had... somebody's dying...
Yes.
Yes, the roving nurse...
How'm I doing so far?
Let's go.
We'd be in all the papers!
We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
I didn't know how to stop you...!
They're really for long distance. When I want to look at something close...  I take them off.
There's only about one explanation for a thing like this..Got a pin?
Automobile ignitions are insulated.
Would you like some coffee, General?
Can you handle one of these?
It's gone now.
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
I feel like I did one time when I was small.  Awful scared and lonesome...I'd wandered off - I've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me.  They found me in a church.  I was afraid to go in any place else.
It was...  ...one of them!
It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.
It might give us something.
No.  I thought you had them.
I'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning.
So is the town, I notice!
I'm here to make up a report, not to interfere with the operations you've set up.  You're still in command.  Clayton Forrester!  I haven't seen you since Oak Ridge.
Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
There's a square dance at the social hall this evening.
I've done about all I can do here. You go back in.  Sylvia - I like that Doctor Forrester.  He's a good man.
Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?
Welcome to California!
I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
You get any sleep last night?
You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
Chase. Hi...
Chase, you'd better come home.
Heather, has there been another call?
Forget those two clowns, Heather.  Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
Just a quick word, Ms. Langenkamp.  For Dylan's sake.
Bye.
The mean old man with the claws.
You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
Promise.  Cross my heart.  But until Mommy gets back, Dylan, whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
Steady...
Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
John.  Will you please just look for him around the hospital?  I'm gonna go right to the house.  Will you help me, John?  Please!
Where's Dylan?!  Have you seen him?
Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
Listen, dammit.
Sure.  We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.
What's that?
Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
Coffee'd be nice.
Black's fine.
You miss him.
He knows.
He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
Guilty.
I haven't forgotten.
He has a lot of hurt inside him.
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
Give me some time to blow the man down...
Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
Watch the tell-tales Chuck.  If we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water.
I didn't know sir.
We've got weather moving in from the west.
Fifteen.
What do you mean?
Okay.
All right.  I'm gonna wander over and look at some shoes...
No, I can't.
What do you mean?
If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.
Nobody says you have to be like me.
I guess.
Well that's just typical isn't it?
Well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know?  Bein' here together an all...
I know you will.
I said "Sorry, wrong room" and walked away.
How do you know?  They might.
Who?
I can't make it out?
Yes sir.
It was my fault.  I slipped.
The fact is... We'd like you to give Phil another chance.
Your cannons made a compelling argument.
I know.
It will be more than that, I can promise you.
He's a big boy.
I should be eating with the crew.
Look, you put me on this boat in the first place.  I didn't want to come but I did.  Why do you have to embarrass me.  Why can't you just leave me alone?
It's okay.  I'll be in, in a minute.  Look, what do you want?
You do?
You're officer of the watch, George.
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
They'll know about it in the morning.
I can show you how to use a slide rule.
Shut up donut.
I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.
You know what he is talking about here?
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
No.
I'm not staying out here.
What?
I'm sorry...
Aaauuuhhh!!!
I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
What makes you so sure it was one?
... and that you invited him to strike you?  To fight it out on the deck of your ship?!
I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
Artie? That you, Artie?
Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
Seein's how you're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don't know how you can criticize.
Well... Yeah - okay.
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
You was in the Marines, huh?
That'd be fine, Bobby.
No, haven't heard of it.
Sorry to hear it.
Then you're a member... Three or four millionaires in here right now.
Ready for another?
She really say she was pregnant?
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
Hey... I never said you was a pussy... Always figured you had the big ol' round balls for this kind'a thing... Sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good.
She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
That's right... Take one of these.
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
Thanks.
Whattaya do there?
Yes. Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary Grant, and he told them there was a shooting.
We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen.
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
If you are truly wild at heart, you'll fight for your dreams... Don't turn away from love, Sailor... Don't turn away from love... Don't turn away from love.
Don't fuck with me, man. You look like a clown in that stupid jacket.
How's that?
The real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
Sailor ain't a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far's I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' Lula. Even there he was protectin' her. You oughta be thankin' him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. Why am I tellin' you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...
This is the kinda mistake can take a Hindu's lifetime to unfix... You better get a move on, Johnnie, before that boy got her holdin' down a Memphis streetcorner and shootin' dope up her arms.
No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
You ain't actin', mama.
Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no murder. Musta been you didn't hear grandmama proper. He made some mistakes, is all. Your daddy ain't always been so lucky... We're almost at the depot, honey. Sit back a minute.
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?
Here she goes again...
I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was.  This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
Yeah?
It ain't altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I ain't too proud of, but I'll tell ya from now on I ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason. All I know for sure is there's more'n a few bad ideas runnin' around loose out there.
You tell the boy who knocked you up?
Hell, peanut...
What's that?
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?
What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
What kinda trash talk is that?
There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.
Let's get fed, sweetheart. The light's fadin' fast.
Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
Lula, darlin'... Makes no difference anyway... We're outta here.
He's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. Look at him.
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
Pardon me? Y'all got a phone here I can use?
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
That'd be good, Lula.
No, Sailor darlin'. Just shockin' sometimes when things aren't the way you thought they were... I been carryin' a secret too...
What's that?
I don't know, honey, but we gotta help that girl - get her to a town and hope no one catches on I broke parole.
Yeah?
Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
And Bobby too, I hear...
Shake hands with your daddy.
Lead the way.
Damn!
HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!!
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.
HELL NO!!! That's the last thing we need... A buncha cops runnin' around.
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
Yes.
No... But...
Someone's gonna see us.
Shhhhhh...  Thank you, gentlemen... I'll look after her now...
No.
Whattya mean?
So?
You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
Life is unpredictable.
Thanks...
Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
She's still a transvestite.
Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
Shut up and drink.
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
Hit your brakes.
Just go around him.
Back up. Go out the other way.
Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.
So sensitive.
So what's the problem?
My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
Call it a hunch.
You did.
You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An internist. And I think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist, as well.
Her dog, yes.
You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
No. Sara, you don't understand...
Really?
I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
I had to. Didn't I?
He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP!
Who?
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
Hm.
Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.
But James. I mean... How long?
No.
Your aunt?
Glaucoma?
Jesus, James. Wow.
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
That's right. That one.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
Jealous? Of me?
The hell I am.
Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack?
And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares what anybody thinks anyway? You want to be a good writer? You want to be a great writer? Then stop giving a damn what other people think. Most of them haven't thought in years.
Arsonist's Daughter meant something.
No thanks.
When nobody's looking.
I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.
Ah, wear whatever you want.
It's Walter's dog and yes, she does know. But let's spare her the details. Come on, your shoes are in the hail.
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
Oh. Well. I...
No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
It beats 'What's your major?'
That good, huh?
Walter just got it back from the framer today.
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
Yes.
Is the thing -- is it over?
It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
I heard.
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
Really? That was fast.
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.
Are you sure you parked it there?
Would Walter really press charges?
I said it didn't sound like you.
Oh?
Some times...
James is... I don't know...
Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind?
What's that?
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
Jesus. Is that what he told you?
It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.
Yes?
Sara. I'm in love with her.
Taking the long way home.
Oh, I don't think there's any danger of you aging prematurely, Grady.
Just kidding.
No, I'm going ho --
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
K through sixth.
Something wrong with that?
I like the noise.
No way, man, you'd rob me blind!
This little table is one heavy bitch.
Huh?
It wasn't like that.
She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it.
No thanks.
Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
Ask me. Ask me anything.
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
It means uncommon beauty is commonly overlooked. Most people only notice birds with the brightest colors.
Have a seat.
Then you won't mind if I look around.
Got something to hide?
They grow outside, don't they?
Little Red Riding Hood.
What?
I have a passionate girlfriend.
Yes.
I'm adjusting okay.
Apartment's okay.
Lovers' quarrel?
Can I ask how old you are?
How come?
It sounds like you were banished.
What will happen if I do?
Robin, listen to me.
I don't mind.
What?
No fucking way.
I'm still thinking about it.
Forget it.
She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings?
If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
We have a few more minutes.
I couldn't say.
I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
I want to talk about it now.
Why?
I'm relaxed.
Not so fast.
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
What picture?
Me?
K through sixth.
Yeah, they could.
What?
I get that impression.
Not tonight.
Don't tell me I'm not a fucking asshole when I know I'm a fucking asshole!
Twelve years in prison is no joke.
What did you do to them?
Twelve years in prison?
What?
I know.
What odds?
Live together.
Who doesn't?
Fine.
Everyone needs a plant. This ivy is one tough baby. It's a cutting from one of mine.
Do what?
Do you want to talk about it?
I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.
Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.
Forget it, Sonny.  They're gone.
Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry!
Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.
I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
Wasn't up to me.
Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.
No.
What do you think he saw?
Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.
Bud, something really important is happening here.
How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
Lindsey!  Wait a second--
Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
Yeah.  So sue me.
They'll come out after us.
Somewhere behind this panel.  Hold this.
I don't know, look around.
Calm down, Bud.
We've only got one suit.
No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.
Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.
Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.
Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
Why bring it here?
We're here now.  Let's get her done.
Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non- human, but intelligent...
Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.
What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?
Turn it up, bozo.
The magnetometer is pegged.  Side-scan is showing a big return, but I don't see anything yet.  Are you sure you got the depth right on this?
Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
What's you depth, Cab Three?
Going over the wall.  Coming to bearing 065. Everybody stay tight and in sight.
We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man.  Give our folks medals, know what I mean?
I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
Check this out.
He's hallucinating badly.
Through three miles of water?   I don't know.
Fine. Can't you see so yourself?
Wait for what?
You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
There will be plenty of time to talk about it later.  We'll  get married  soon.  That way we'll have more time...
But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?
I'm thirsty.
What! After giving us such a run around...
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
You already know what they are.
It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.
But even here we were supposed to find who knows what... And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.
Well, what?
All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
Oh, no... please... not here.  It looks too dangerous.
And why haven't they left each other?
And why do you tell us this only now?
I know. I keep asking myself what I could have done to prevent all this from happening.
Yes... but it's all so conflicting... However, there is some slight indication...
And why did you drop them?
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
It was futile. We went all over.
No.
To the shark.
He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.
We'll try again.
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning to contradict each other.  Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat?
Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
Yes, she takes care of the garden.
But for you, what comes first: music or love?
Unfortunately, no.
What boat?
What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.
Good. Then I'll meet you there.
You're kidding!
One of the other Sisters?
Agnes...
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
It's not that... it's not that...
It's not my time of month.
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
What would you like to talk about.
Yes.
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
At least once a week.
Do you remember the night they said it came?
And what happened?
After God... before the waste-paper basket.
Agnes, how are babies born?
No.
I can't have them any more.
I've stopped menstruating
Does it bother you?
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
You'll laugh.
No.
I could never be a mother.
Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
Everything... I don't have children.
That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her.
She can.
... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
Yes.
She touches me down there with a cigarette.  Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good,  I won't be a baby any more.
Yes.
But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
No.
What do you do?
I don't know which one 
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
Go away, I don't want you here.
Frightened.
Yes.
Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
When?
Who are you?
I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
Yes... I...
Two packs a day.
Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
What's your opinion?
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
And in your eyes?
That she was unconscious, yes!  So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
How dare you tell me to run my affairs!
How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...
... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room.
I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
Oh, dear God.
Oh God, if only I'd known.
I'd like yours too.
You just said...
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
No, it reminds me.
Oh, you've come a long way baby.
Listen to her singing.
Of course.
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
Well give me a reasonable explanation
That's a lie.
I left it with her and I went for help.
What happened to the baby?
Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?
Are you now?
Please do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.
Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
Spoil sport!
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
No, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.
No. I don't.
I'll have a bash.
No, straight up.
He's sulking again.
He hasn't.
The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.
Is he?
If I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?
You're getting out of hand. I don't know what's come over you today.
Come here.
I've got you worried, haven't I?
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
Is she?
Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!
Books are good!
What's that mean?
Yeah ... that's right.
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
Lip reading.
Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
It's your nose, y'see. Fans are funny that way. Take a dislike to things. They'll pick on a nose...
Hiding.
What little old man?
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
Don't be callous.
Will you stop it! Sorry to disturb you, miss...
Eh, don't take out me lines.
You needn't bother.
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
Well you're not going.
Well, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.
Hi, our lot!
Aye, let's try the dressing room.
What?
No, not me.
I'm not, no.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
Oh, leave off!!!
Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.
Y'what?
It's not my fault.
Who?
Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
And they want me?
You were twanging too loud.
Oh, him... He's been lurking.
Is that you, Roby?
Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen.
Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.
No.  Just some horrible dreams about smothering.  Where are we?
Sandy, scan the whole sky.
Point eight six.  We can walk on it.
I'll see what I can do.
Receiving.
Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
What is it, I can't --
You want to try?
Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom yet.  Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
It is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man.
Right.  Talk to you.
It grows on you.
That way.
All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure.
Dead.
It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
Yeah, but how?  His nose and mouth are blocked.
It wouldn't come.
I'll come with you.
That's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock.
The flamethrower needs more fuel.
Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full.  I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as... 
The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.
We're not going anywhere.
Oh... God...
It doesn't make any sense.  It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.
And right next to it, that oval design with the markings -- it's a dead ringer for the spore casings.
We can use the flamethrower.
Thanks for the thought. 
That creature sure must have considered it important... using his last strength to draw it...
What is it?
Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans.
They're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb.  God knows how long they've been here.
Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.
Room by room, corridor by corridor.
We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust.  We are utterly, absolutely alone.  Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  Halfway across Creation...
Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.
Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
Sandy, contact traffic control.
Good!  Moisture content?
Good.  I'm getting you clear too. Let's just keep the line open.
Oh well... you know me.
Is that its mouth?
If we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship --
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
I guess we open the door and net it.
Go ahead, Jay.
So the next step should be --
... More spores coming.
That kind of remark is pointless. Now come on -- I want to hear every suggestion you can come up with, no matter how wild.
It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it.
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
What?  What's wrong?  What is it?
And?
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
Has anybody talked to them?
Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left.
How?
Thanks.
York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary.
Where does that lead to?
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
And before that?
Just curious.  There's a lot of talk goes around.
'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign a release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board.
What do I think?  I think if those Marines from Powell don't shift their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't.
Don't wait for me!
I consider myself lucky they didn't throw things.
You're more than kind. But it's still Miss Channing's performance. I'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original...
I'm not enough for a paragraph.
Yes. The Shubert.
I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...
Just some coffee.
Frankly - yes.
Paved with what, then?
Almost four.
... and Karen.
Well, say something - anything! Congratulations, skol - good work, Eve!
I was there, I saw you and heard you through the dressing room door!
No-no-no...
Yes, Addison.
Couldn't go on? You'll give the performance of your life.
Well, I can't yell "Oh, butler," can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler...
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
Gable. Why a feller like that don't come East to do a play...
As soon as the peasants stop pawing her.
We have that in common.
Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
I take it she read well.
We know you, we've seen you before like this. Is it over - or just beginning?
I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...
When - when are you coming back?
- in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...
The reading could have been better, but you said it - now "many happy returns of the day..."
I love you...
She's a girl of so many interests.
I can always get a fresh one. Karen - you're a Gibson girl...
What's all over?
Gone.
Don't mix your metaphors.
What a body, what a voice.
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
I'll say.
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
Margo, let's make peace.
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
He does not exaggerate. I was good.
A foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady... that's for me. And no more make believe! Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd.  I mean it, now. Grown-up women only, I might even play a mother - only one child, of course, not over eight...  Lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me?
Eve. Eve Harrington.
Is it the money?
You didn't have to tell me.
Everything.
From what would I be running?
I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
Only thing, what I go after, I want to go after. I don't want it to come after me.
No thanks, Birdie.
I never played Fort Sumter.
If I haven't, I'll find something till you're normal.
Something maybe grew a size bigger.
Behind in your dues? How much?
Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
Miss Harrington...
I - I guess I fell asleep.
What for?
Probably not.
Subway.
I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
Standing room doesn't cost much. I manage.
Oh, no...
My husband...
It couldn't possibly interest you.
Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality...  ... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket...  ... you've done your share, Eve. You've worked wonders with Margo...
The show must go on.
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
There can't be very much-
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
I'm not crying.
I wish I'd never met him, I'd like him to be dead... I want my friends back.
It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.
Not at all...
Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me...
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-
Hello, Miss Channing.
Really, Eve? Why?
Why not?
Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
They're your fans, your audience-
I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
You're Margo. Just - Margo.
Well...
Lloyd says it's a publicity release...
With tears.
The critics thought so, the audiences certainly think so - packed houses, tickets for months in advance - I can't see that either of Lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any!
It's about time we did! It's about time Margo realized that what's attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off.
Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
Margo. Margo's great. She knows it. That's the trouble. She can play Peck's Bad Boy all she wants, and who's to stop her? Who's to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves?
That was a pity...
I wonder why.
I'm beginning to catch up.
Margo!
Nothing...
That was way back...
I have no intention of having an accident!
Too bad.
Lloyd, I want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
A couple of weeks.
Well...
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
About the past year.
The fucking New York Times.
--you do?--with access to records?
Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.
I never scared anyone before.
I just wish we knew when someone would talk to us, that's all.
It's safe, try it, you'll see.
Go on, go on--
You want me to be the bastard.
--shit, who do we know?--
Segovia begged me for me secret but I said, "No, Andres, you'll have to try and make it without me."
We're inside the White House now.
It's nothing personal, though. 
--he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman--
Hmm?
Only everything...
Goddamnit!--
John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--
--Teddy Kennedy?
Well of course.
They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
Carl, it's a jungle.  I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles.  You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for.
I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
...No... never in so many words...
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
Who were they?
'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
--they're worse. That's why I quit.
To cover up?
I'm not your source on that.
--let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
My non-denial denial.
Go on.
Ben, Jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom?
How senior?
--he went to her apartment and he told her--
--I'm not here.
Clearly, I am here, but only as an individual, I'm not the attorney of record.  Mr. Rafferty has that position. Whatever you want, you'll have to get from him, I have nothing more to say.
That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
...you're definitely doing a story...?
I'm a proper citizen, I'm a decent man, I don't do anything that isn't decent or proper.  I know I shouldn't tell you this...
That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg.
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
Government. Recently retired.
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
--I'm Woodward.
No.
I couldn't say.
Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
I did all right on McCord.
Lotsa hints--
I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.
Larry Young, a California lawyer--
My wife told me to expect you.  As you know, I haven't talked to the press.
One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
...okay...
I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
Pardon me?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
Uh-huh.
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
Seduce her.
Charming.
So Oz, you almost made it, huh?
Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?
Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."
You can call me Oz.
That's nice.
Sure.
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
You called me Oz.
I know, it sucks!
Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Then what the hell are you talking about?
Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
I do, baby, I do.
Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.
She's already on a plane back home.
No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
Oh, okay.  Here's let me show you.
Do you know about the clitoris?
I know.  Hey Nadia.
Highly, highly overrated.
Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
No -- Kevin, you?
Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer --  Cool Hip Jim...  or Laid Back Jim?
Oh -- no way.  I can't do that to her.
You've got something going?
Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards.  I can change clothes at your place?
Nadia, I can't --
You think so?
Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
Not for you.
Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.
Just a second!
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."
I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
No...I know the perfect time...
Yeah.  Are you sure?
Yeah.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
Ready for what?
Uh...I thought you might know a trick or something.  To make her, you know...
Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
I'm such a loser.
Observe.
Attitude?  Me?  I think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!
I don't care.
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
Dude, watch me work.  They go for sensitive studs like me.
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.
Serafine...?
Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence...
I'll be right back. Stay put.
Andy! No!
I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
Yeah. French fries...
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
No. We have to try. We'll figure something out. And if midnight comes before we can get to him, well, then we go together. Deal?  Shake a paw?
"Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead."
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
You too.
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...
You'll never get the chance.
Hey, I'm new here, what do you want?
Sure. Don't you?
Looks like he lied to you too.
My God! Serafine's right. It's time to go. We'll talk soon.
Sort of...
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?
How well did, er, do you know him?
Good man. Now can I have my arms back?
I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
I told you. These murders are not normal.
Allo?
He says -
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
When you're older . . .
Get on! Anastasia, get on!
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me!
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.
Why?
Now just get off the train.
Sad?
Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
Is it? Is this what you want?
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
And we have found each other nothing will ever change that! I am your family, dear child, but I may not be your home.
How do you know?
Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
"Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
But it's not	the money, Vlad.
Rasputin!
I should go
Promise me she'll have her home.
And tell me that she's happy.
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
Oh, heavens, no... but ...  She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect.
You don't want my autograph.
Alvy Singer over here!
What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
Who are you?
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
It's okay.
Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
Alvy.
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
Hey, you... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?
Get him!
Me? Oh, downtown!
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
Well, I do commercials, sort of...
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
Huh? Oh... yeah.
Yeah, my grammy.
Yeah, I know.
Well...
You sure?
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
M'hm...
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
No, so help me.
What?
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
Good? I was-
No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and
H'm?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I dunno.
Of course.
I have a tiny apartment.
Mine.
Well, have you ever made love high?
Let's just do it, all right?
C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.
Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
M'm.
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
Sinatra?
Well, well, sure... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
And, Alvy... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough.
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
Oh. What?
It's for my complexion.
Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.
I don't know.
That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
Uh huh. Yeah. Forget it.
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
Thing?
It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.
Nothing at all?
Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A pat on the androgynous side. But it's...
Oh, Alvy, come on.
Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh  h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
I'm late.
I thought just earplugs.
What's fascinating is that it's physical. You know, it's one thing about intellectuals, they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what's going on. But on the other hand...  the body doesn't lie, as-as we now know.
Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?
You catch Dylan?
The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
He's God! I mean, this man is God! He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.
Yeah.
It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a...
...as opposed to a print...
Oh, do yuh?
Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So... so, here, just let me- I mean, all right. Come over here... a second.
Hey.
Whatta you mean?
You stopped smoking sixteen years ago, is that what you said? Oh, I-I don't understand. Are you joking, or what?
Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
Since you put it that way.  It's hard for me to refuse.  ...have a, I have a terrific problem with authority, you know. I'm... it's not your fault. Don't take it personal.
Ah, Max, you, uh...
Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.
Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college...
Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
Look, uh...
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Hi.
SO?
Who's persecuting? She stole!
I look pretty.
I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out. It'd probably wreck her. But I should be honest.
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
...of possibly working together.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You should talk to Mr. Joe.
A triumph.  When did you get here?
Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
Borrow whatever you like.
You want a Tylenol, or something?
It's not going to come up.
Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
Oh my God, the sitter.
And you're not the wife.
When does he graduate high school?
Harry called.
She left a note.
We live next door.
Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
I don't think so.
Anytime, sport.
I adore him.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
Before I forget.  Put it on the bookshelf.
Beats a lawsuit.
I'm ready.
Oh, well, we'll just have to try again. Sound like a plan?
Through the sweats or not?
No.  I missed that.
Well, it might be Clair.  They're threatening not to come...
No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
I'll say as little as possible.
And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a rock star in London.  His novels sell millions.
Who'd like to go and find Otis?
Panes is not on your team anymore.
Truce?
Listen to yourself...  Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him.  What's wrong with you?
Well he can't have gone far.
He'll find his way back.
Otis!!!!
This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.
Otis!
Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this.
I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
Me too.
Ah...
Will you make love with me?
Sure.
Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book.
It's very good.  I understand you won the Booker Prize.
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
I meant Sally.
Right away.  Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan?
Hm.
Lemon.
A lot of cakes.
Sorry?
You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director.
This is an amazing present.  What a sweetheart you are.
Not good.
He always has two or three going...
You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words.
You're not serious.
Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.
Yes.
Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
If he were still alive, maybe.
Are you asking me to marry you?
Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty...  Five.
She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
Like your business managers?
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
"We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why don't you stay with us for a while?" "I'd love to, thanks."
"Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here."
I'm worried about your Galiano.
I never like to talk about my work.
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
Well, so glad you decided to come.
Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
Ah.
I thought it was okay where it was.
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
And Cal's this massive adult?
Neither does Joe.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
Z?  <u>Our</u> Z?  The little guy made it!
Right...because every ant's important!
You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
Wait!  When can I see you again?
Well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes I am.
I'm Princess Bala.
Divinely?
SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!
How should <u>I know</u>?
Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
Climb up that tree and get a better view!
Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?
Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.
I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
Outstanding.  Princess...?
Ant Team Six...
Oh, no, sir!
So...you two are in love?
Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
...Ants...
Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...
You're a real buddy.
My mother.
Yeah.  How much?
Something the matter?
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
Oh!
It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off.  Big mistake, huh?
Really?  I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
Good night.
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
Would you like to?
Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
So I see.
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
No -- I like it.
Of course not.
I think so.
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
Two o'clock.
I just want to go brush my teeth --
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
I mean -- her apartment.
Miss. 
Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
Yes, I've got it.  Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
Are you supposed to?
Oh.
It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
You ought to see my backhand.  And wait till I serve the meatballs. 
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
No, thank you.  I -- well, to tell you the truth --  -- I have this heavy date for tonight --
That's very wise.
That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I know everything that goes on in this building -- in every department -- on every floor -- every day of the year.
You better.
Oh, it won't. Believe me. And it's not going to happen again. From now on, nobody is going to use my apartment --
Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
The mirror is broken.  It was broken when I found it.
I didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who I mean -- I found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
Save it. The old payola won't work any more. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
You?
That's right.  We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise --  -- and I told him what a bright boy you were.  They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.
Oh, I'm very grateful.
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch.  You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
Of course not.  But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
Hi, Doc.  Had a late call?
Yeah.  Well -- see you, Doc. 
Get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it isn't too late. You better put some coffee on -- and pray.
Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
Sure, Doc.
Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.  By the way, whatever happened to her?
Happy New Year.
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
No.
No.
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
You bet I will. And when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in.  You fink!
Who?
No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
A.W.O.L.?
That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
I took sleeping pills.
I don't know.
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
Important?
Handle what?
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.
Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
The nerve.
I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
Don't you ever stop talking?
You mean you bring other girls up here?
Bob WHO? -- all right, so we'll watch it at the apartment. Big deal.  Baxter? It's okay for Thursday.
What gives?
That's fine. But what are we going to do about grandma and Uncle Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two nieces --
You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
It's a thought.
Oh -- oh!
What's it matter? Get to the point.
Yeah.
I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --
My men --
That's what there is to talk about -- my man -- I take a good care of my men --
We have a lot of pride in our unit --
We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too --
I will -- I assure you that -- You got a fifty on that H-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em --
Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.
I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
Fat. That's real fat.
He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back.
That we're dumber than we look.
Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang. But we're running low on the other.
I know.
Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him, just like he said.
Sure.  Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.
... he's an amazing officer.
Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw the fucking flash.
Said I speak French like a Spanish cow.
We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
Signs?
Which way? Right or left?
If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.
Anyone got a cigarette.
Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't believe he's capable of that. I just don't believe it.
Ours.
What is it?
They must have seen the fire.
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
Well, he's killing now.
Of course, Captain -- an unfortunate necessity.
You'll get blown outta here some day.
I always thought the French came here to get the rubber.
Do you know that jungle?
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
That's right, sir.
What, sir?
Yeah -- yeah, I can understand how you feel.
It's still pretty hairy, sir.
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
Yeah -- Na Trang told me to expect you -- we'll see what we can do. Just stay out of my way till this is done, Captain.
No. They put out two or three for every one I needed. When you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out. If something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars.
When did you hear?
I met him.
You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
You can't have water after morphine.
I can handle it.
Oh Captain, that is so true.
Yes I was... He said his last words to me.
Which one's the Colonel's?
Yeah, Jesus Christ !
That's me.
So Kurtz is alive.
Why didn't he shoot you?
I'm sorry to hear that.
I should be checking on the boat.
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him.
I know.
The river is beautiful.
You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much.
Then Philippe will have to kill all of you.
Right now -- I am.
I don't know -- don't have any idea -- I'm just the night man --
Son of a bitch, sir.
Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be?
Now, why don't you get around to saying what you want.
Wait 'til I'm across!
107  CONTINUED:
I'll get you there all right.
I just want this over with.
I'd sure like that favor you offered a while back.
I was making my rounds, saw your hangar wide open, plane getting rained on, so I closed it up.
Six months.
Somewhere along the pipeline.
Sam?  We haven't seen him.
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.
I've got an idea.  We'll have to work fast.
No big deal.  We just got off on the wrong foot.  What's your name?
You sound like the tourists. Know-it-alls who read about survival in a magazine.  Fuck you.  You won't make it off this mountain.
That's right.  You're not.
I've been on ice like this when I was a kid, skating.  Spread your weight, keep moving.  Go on.
We've got another two hours of daylight.
Forget it.  It would take days.
You know Meyerling?
I'm here to do my job.
You don't get it, do you?
If that means freeze my balls off, no thanks.  I'll be okay.
How many do you see?
You got one?
Told that's what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, 'til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.  That was fine money.
You got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them.
I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.
You kill me, you sign your death warrant.  And hers.
You're wrong.  Everything we do leaves its mark.  You said it yourself -- there are hundred- year-old footprints in the tundra.
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
You left a footprint at the Sportsmen's camp.  Only pretty sight there, Ben, 'cause the two men you didn't shoot and mutilate died of exposure.
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
Sure.
-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
Some day these people'll wake up, and you'll be the first one they'll run out of here.
-- We appreciate the company. Anne Marie's getting cabin fever already.
Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
Cool out.  I ain't about to get blasted.
I'm right fuckin' here with you.
That plane might've been to throw us off the track.  Remember the bait-and-switch Wilder pulled with the Eskimo and his truck?
They'll have to come right past us.
I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts.  This can't be right -- con- science.
Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...
I want us to go out.
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
No, I didn't.  So why are you h...
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
Since forever.
No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
They're considerable. But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.
Will you please take it?
I see the help -- judgement call.
Otherwise, you're not ugly.
What are you doing here?
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
Yes.
A thank-you note for what you did for me.
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
Thank you.
I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.
What's that got to do with it?
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
Yes... sure.  I'll take the sofa.
No...  ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake.  I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.
Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.
Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...
I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
It was a mistake.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
I'll take a bus.
I can trust my brain.
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
I had to see you...
It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
Okay.
No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.
I'll take care of myself --
No. No. Get Carol.
There's not going to be a debate. You must leave.
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
Sure -- take him to the vet.
Do it.
"What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.
Think white and get serious.
What?
See, he's right. I need the cards.  Simon, you're broke.
Well, I can't reach them.
No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
Ask him.
I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall.
'Love was... '
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
Thank you for walking him.
Where are all your queer party friends?
Come on, sweetheart...
You consider your life easy.
... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- truly. A little odd that you didn't come to see me when you heard I was hurt, but the important thing I want you to know is your son is happy. I'm working again. I'll make do -- I don't want a thing. Wouldn't take it if it was offered. I'll drop you a note from wherever I land and then it's up to you. I hope we patch things up but know that if we don't, I wish you both the very best... I can't hear you. You heard me, though, right? Good -- take good care. 'Bye.
I'm going back with you.
Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...
What are you talking about?
I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.
No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there...  I just want to tell you...
How long have you been freelance?
It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty- forty, at best.  Not my odds.
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
Oh, yeah.
Now I'll tell you something.  It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few minutes I'm going to take you.
No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.
I don't give a fuck what you are.  I asked you --
I know.  It was a joke.
Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.
The contract?
We have an M.O... Her system is protected by her 'pussy virus.'
He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?
One hour per man.
Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
Yeah.
No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
Another contractor.
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
Because he is trying to retire me.
This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money.
He will know everything about you. Everything.  I know, because I've done it.  Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him.
Just Electra?
He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
Where you wanted to be?
How did you get into the business?
The C.I.A.?
They didn't give you a choice, did they?
Ahhhh...
Why not?
Thinking.
No.
You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.
I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping.
Sorry.
And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
We split the money?
For Nicholai?
Yes.
He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
So?
I didn't notice them.
What?
Jesus, if someone had --
Thank you.
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
Did he explain how this happened?
Why?
Yes.
She was taken.
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
I'm not sure that I care anymore.
What?
Okay.
Yes.
The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
I think you're supposed to answer that question.
Do you believe that?
Just a little ways.  Up to those trees.
It's a common question.
Taken.
I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
I'm thinking about Moonpies.  Ain't that funny?  I haven't had a Moonpie since I was ten years old. Right now, I'm thinking how much I'd love one.
You mean quit?
American currency.
It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.
Yeah, group bloody therapy time.
Son of the American ambassador and a banker - good enough?
Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
No you don't get it. Every cabby in town knows this joint. So where's the mystery, the danger?
Give'em a break Doug, all it takes is a little work.
You've got to stop using that word "we" it's getting kind of scary. Right Katka?
Care to elaborate?
Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
Sure....As for the crap, I've got an idea.
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?
Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
Yes, but it suddenly clicked, this is going to be a crazy place and, since the Commies are used to seeking asylum, we can use that in the marketing.
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
Am I late?
Who put a bee up your butt?
When your ready Son!
You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
No beer?
What?
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
Hey Jahn.....You got a name for this thing?
He's lying! I am.
That bad?
So I hear.
He got that one right.
What happened?
What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?
Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there.
Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn't work. You'd better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know someone with a phone?
Here!
Listen, Doug took the rap for us all so grab your coat 'cause you're going.
What are you talking about?
No!
Yeah....Shit, those guys have guns.
No!
Hmm, I see possibilities but you got a lot to do.
What?
Look Kat it'll only take ten minutes. Without Jahn I might never find it... We'll just have a quick look and then you and I'll hit a tram.
I'm sorry but it's been a crazy evening. I'm going to make that place into something big. God, I love you!
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
No way Doug, I can't.
No, it's not true, you're lying.
And, since it's only two streets away, I suggest we go take a look. Now!
Great. And your all set for the performance?
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
What is bail?
No, it should be over soon.
Am I invited?
Yeah seems okay.
I had it coming from someone.
Sure!
Yeah, but it was okay.
Hmm, I still owe him.
Alright!
I lied to you, I didn't destroy the floppy disks.
First, I want to walk free with a letter, in English, from the Prosecutor General dropping all charges. Second, I want two first class tickets to London leaving tonight and three thousand crowns in a stamped envelope. Lastly, all actions against the students are to be stopped!
You may use my office.
Yeah!
Yeah.
No problem, is it at your place?
Oh that's it? Everything I do is crap!
It's time to go home, Holly.
Leave me, just leave me alone Josh.
We're not sure...
Some Americans?
I don't care about Americans. Arrest them all if you have to, but keep those records secret.
I'm sorry about how we --
He wants to show now.
Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.
Be yourself and I don't think there is a wrong thing.  Let Jamie take the lead. She'll let you know what she needs.
No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
No. Thanks. Gotta keep my wits for the drive home.
Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?
'They won't.'
Like me.
The world of the dead?
You don't believe in anything?
Sometimes I don't even trust me.
I'm really glad you think so.
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
Thank you. So were you.
And why would that scare me?
It means you can do anything.
What?
I have to get you home by one.
We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.
No.
That what's happening to you, only faster?
Where?
Where?
Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job.
I was twelve.
No. Why? Are you seducible?
What about your father?
Me.
Because I had it named for you. I know it's not an official designation --
Yes, one of many.
I'm sick.
I'm not going back to school.
Lower. Same page.
Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one.
No.
I have expectations, too.
Jamie, you're not mad at me. You're mad at Landon --
I don't want to see her hurt.
Like what, sir?
Okay. Sure.  My grandfather. When he was seven, he shook the hand of an old guy, a war vet or something, who had once shaken President Lincoln's hand.  Made a big impression on him.
In there.
She did. But hardly anyone does anything truly alone.
I want to come back.
Please.
I'm as underprivileged as they are --
Where did you get -- ?
I didn't say you did.
You came here to give me my report card?
Marty. What's for breakfast?
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
Oh, I'm feeling much better now.
But he didn't ask me.
Oh, no, I'm fine...fine.
You do?
Saturday night's the 'Springtime in Paris' dance. I'm taking Suzy Parker.
Well... yeah...
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.
Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.
You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class.  If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.
Run out of gas?
Five cents, please.
Operator, what's today's date?
What year?
That reminds me, if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain, I've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house -- we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater.
AM or PM?
Get behind the shield! I'm about to release radiation!
The future? What are you talking about? Where's Shemp?!
Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.
That's just great!
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
You did what?!?
I brought it with me from 1982. It's from my science book.
Believe me, Professor, running around on a nuclear test site can't be any more dangerous than what I've been doing.
Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.
Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
It'll be fine, Marty.  You'll be fine. Good luck. He stuck his hand out and Marty shook it. But there was still a question that was nagging at him...
87 states? Time travel bans? What the hell?
No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
What did you do to yours?
What's going on?
Yeah.
Okay.
Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
Is that right?
Yeah. I can imagine.
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
He'll say that?
There you go.
Something mi trabajo.
I know.
Yeah, but I don't like it.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
I don't care.
But it would hurt.
Positive?
Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
No.
Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.
Really?
Just thinking.
Yes.
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
Name is Carruthers. Believe I shoot people every now and then. Not that I deserve a medal.
Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.
The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?
It's your hand, Buckaroo.
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
Let her out. In my custody.
It?  Who does?
Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
To get my guns.
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
A what?
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
Yes I am. I'm working on a wres  please call me Barton.
It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes?
What are they like? What are they about?
Before Bill came to Hollywood.
What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
I'll bet. Jesus  "The grand productive days." What a goddamn phony.
Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 
What DID you mean?
A week, eight, nine days 
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
All right, forget the heads. Where's Mundt, Fink?
We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
But Lipnik said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week.
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started
I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
To see pap.
I don't know, Garland; my place is here right now. I feel I'm on the brink of success-
It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
Not big in the sense of large  although it's that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done.
That's all right, really, thank you.
Okay... a quick one, sure...
That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies  though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,
And I could tell you some stories 
Well, I can tell you some stories 
See you, Charlie.
No, I guess you're stuck with the one you've got. Have a seat.
Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now...
Okay, but hell, you should know what it is. I can show you in about thirty seconds.
Well hell, buddy, don't pull a long face!  This is still home for me  I keep my room, and I'll be back sooner or later...
No... Can I come in?
Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
I've gotta call the police  or you could call for me 
I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me!
We gotta call the police 
You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on  just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.
Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll help you finish your script. You'll think about me...
Lou.
...Both maybe?
Must be.
Uh-huh.
You're a sick fuck, Fink.
Excellent picture.
Hell, I could take you through it step by step, explain why your story stinks, but I won't insult your intelligence. Well all right, first of all: This is a wrestling picture; the audience wants to see action, drama, wrestling, and plenty of it. They don't wanna see a guy wrestling with his soul  well, all right, a little bit, for the critics  but you make it the carrot that wags the dog. Too much of it and they head for exits and I don't blame 'em. There's plenty of poetry right inside that ring, Fink. Look at "Hell Ten Feet Square".
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
Home. Watching TV.
Yeah.
When did you start drinking again?
No.
No!  I'm working my tail off.  I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore.
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
Thank you.
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking him.
About a year and a half.
I quit.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong woman.
No.  I said I liked Johnny to use his hands.  I don't give any rules, Nick.  I go with the flow.
I've got a degree in psych.  It goes with the turf.  Games are fun.
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
No.
Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew.
I know, Nicky, but I like it.
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
To see if he can get away with it.
No.
To see if I can get away with it.
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
When?
What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.
I did, too.  She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did.
Did you miss me?
Really.  What are you writing about.
It won't sell.
What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?
I had sex with him for about a year and a half.  I liked having sex with him.
I like that.  "Suspension of Disbelief."
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
What was the weapon?
Was his wife ever a suspect?
I hope I helped you out.
Hell yes!  Couldn't get it outta my head for years.  Still can't. Nice little kids -- nice husband, wasn't porkin' around -- no financial problems.  One day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em.  All of 'em.  Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn't even deny it.  Sweet as honey.  Said she didn't know why she done it.
I got tired of being played with.
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
You don't like punk rockers?
Which one you talkin' about now, son?  We know ole Hazel did it; we know young Roxy did it -- and the other one Well, hell, she's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain.
He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it.
Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.
Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
You don't but it, do you?  She knew nobody would but it.  She knew I'd say she did it.  And she knew nobody would buy it.
It was an accident.
You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?
I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend.
Can there be some mistake?
No. Should I have?
Really. Huh. Too bad.
Not sure. How was yours?
I think it's in New Jersey.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Ignorant art?
That's good. At least they're interested.
I don't like beer.
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
Annina Nosei.
No.
Hi Dad. Hi Nora.
I can get ten.
You haven't heard? Andy's dead.
You're not?
Yup.
Very well.
SAMO.
Oh  you mean black people!
Who's John Henry?
For real?
I guess it was a long time ago.
You don't have any fucking money..
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
You want some?
Think so?
You mean babies with you?
Me? Why?
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
You like your dad's paintings?
Haitian. I'm going to kill myself. I'm taking pills. Reds, blues, greens.
No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
Can you put me in the ring with him?
Jean Michel Basquiat.
Fuck...  I forgot about that.
Yes, Boss.  If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
Yeah.
That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
I need this?
Right.  Sure.  And "Peace on earth, good will toward men."
"Shreck's."  You --
...four, five.
I tried to grab you -- save you --
Yes and no ...
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
Well, I could ... free up some time...
Treat to be here.
I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
Had one.  Didn't work.
Nope, I told her everything.
Nor I, on the second.
I don't know.  Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.
Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office.  If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to --
It does to me.
A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
He'd have more power as a martyr. No, to destroy Batman we must first turn him into what he hates most.  Meaning, us.
You're off the hook, Ozzie.  But Batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.
Dad!  Save yourself!
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
No, just give you a splitting headache.
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.
I think you'd feel out of place at my party.  You see, it's for winners.
What is it?
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
Alfred, am I pigheaded?  Is it always my way or the highway?
Passion.  Of course.  Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball.
Keep it.
You'd be surprised.
Damn?  Damn is not good.
I hate being lectured.
No, Robin.  He's going to jail.
I can make it.
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
Definitely.
Open Sesame...Chicken.
She knows who we are.
Maybe he melted.
I have here a proposal showing how Wayne Enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment.
Can I get some help over here?
Presumed dead.  No one knows.
Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
Her name is Pamela Isley.  I saw her talking to Gordon.  She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
Fine.  While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  She's frozen in -
Adam and Evil.
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
I'm hungry.  I think I'll have poultry.
I find that unlikely.
Then you never loved me?
What exactly are you working on in there?  What are those screams?
I think they're getting worse.
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
What did you say?
Which `they' might that be, sir?
Why, indeed?
Dr. Meridian...
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
Recognition, of course.
Enigma.
How ya doin', Al?
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
You like strong women. I've done my homework. Or do I need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely disappointing. When all this could have been ours together.
Just ones this beautiful.
On occasion. Usually at night.
Wacko? That a technical term?
The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...
You understand obsession better than you let on.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
I'm not-
Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman.  Can I?
Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-
Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
You do know. Try.
What?
Look, spare me the sermons, okay. You're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed. You don't even know me.
What I do isn't about revenge.
Who is it?
A man with a death wish.
Addictive isn't it? Just Say No. Until I say yes. A little fringe benefit of working with me. Now here's the concept, counselor. Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help me gather production capital so I can produce enough of these  to create an empire that will eclipse Bruce Wayne's forever. And, in return I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all. Who is Batman?
Haven't you had enough? Don't Think And Drive.
Kill me? Well, alright. Go ahead. Take the empire. All yours.  Hell, Harv, old pals. I'll kill me for you.
Respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you.
Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
Too many people. Come on!  SHIELDS!!
... A hundred and eight?
Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.
I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
You're just back from Corto Maltese.  I saw your combat photos.  Quite a departure for you.
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
... Terror.
I'll take you home if you'd like.
Maybe we should just kiss.
Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is -- Now you'll have to kill me.
... Looks like a convention.
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !
He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
WHAT?
Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
God!  How old are you?  There ain't no bat.
Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
Because I want someone I can trust.
JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
Alicia!  Come here, have a seat.  Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask.
What?  I improved her a little...
Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale.  If I had a good enough hint.
Too much glamor, huh.  What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo?  Apes in Kenya?
What were you thinking?
Well, he must like the way he looks.  He's got a mirror in every room.
Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.
Allie, he's not.
You okay?
Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short.
I said I'd check with you.
What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
Ah, well .... CUT TO:
It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?
I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down.  I have a tale to tell.  And not a happy one.
Right first time.
Uh ... yes ...
Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....
Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
Great - keep him out of trouble.
I don't think you really understand what you're looking at ...
Love to, sir, but no can do.  No spare room.  Period.
I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
Okay, sir.  Certainly.  Good.
No. Perfect.  Looking forward to it. CUT TO:
Ahm....
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...
A car sounds sensible.
No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.
Great, good.
Bye, Bean.  Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?  I know it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.
Okay.....
Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.  Going on To my regiment/s reunion after.
I am sorry you feel that way.
Nope.
What?
Yeah, heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. He's a anus. Heh heh.
No it wasn't!
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
What a rip-off. Come on. We gotta find that chick.
Heh heh. This is the best night of our lives.
Yeah, heh heh, enough'a this crap.
Huh huh. You mean like this?
Yeah. We can go see Hole and then we can get some hole. Huh huh huh huh.
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
Just make sure it looks like an accident...
Washington! That's where she was gonna meet up with ya?  Damn, she's goin' all the way!
Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again.
Agent Hurley...
Where are his pants?
Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
No, Jane.
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.
I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
That's how long you were gone.
I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?
What's she doing here?
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
Not really...  what's this?
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
No.  But it's somewhere without big worms.
It's <u>not</u> stupid.  We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  Moan louder!
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
Who did the sushi?
Let's see if she can get my model back.
Just a hunch.
3:30 I guess.
<u>Night of the Living Dead</u>?  It's this gross movie.
We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
Can you scare them off?
<u>Out</u>.
Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
Home.  <u>Home</u>.  <u>Home</u>!
What do you mean?  What's he do?
About what?
I always tell the truth.  Of course I can see you.
Step... mother.
I think so.
Yes.
It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
Just <u>say</u> it.
How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
It's too late, Charles.  I'm sorry.
There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better.
At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
Delia hates it.
Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
Let me have it.
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
Listen, you guys.  These ghosts are really nice people.  I think we scared them off.  Let's just leave them alone.  Okay?
Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.
No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
I'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.
What happened to the people who used to live here?
That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.
I see.
Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me.
There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
Yes, I will.
No, Robert.
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
In a day or two, yes.
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
No. I like this attic very much.
Yes. I am.
I agree.
Yes. I lost my remote control.
No. I like it here.
Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before.
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
That's good.
Yes. I was.
Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
Yes, so do we.
Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.
I like the President. He is a very nice man.
No, Eve. I like you to be here.
No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
I like to watch.
Yes. I like to watch.
Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.
I have nothing more to say.
Yes, I do, it's very good.
Your foot! Give me your foot!!
Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
Yes. I like that name very much.
... I see.
I agree.
I understand.
I see, Ben.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
I like to watch.
Yes.
I can't write.
Yes. I like to watch.
Yes.
Yes.
Oh. Thank you.
I never needed money.
... Yes. You can take me.
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
Yes. It is.
Yes, I'm very hungry.
Yes.
You're welcome.
No. I don't object.
Yes. I was there with Ben.
Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds.
... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
I see...
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
No.
No, I do not have any of those.
Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile.
Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased.
... Oh, really...
Yes, I will.
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
... Yes, I am, Ben.
Yes, ma'am.
No, that won't do any good.
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
Gladly...  ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
Very good, Your Excellency.
Gardiner, yes, sir.
Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
That could be possible...
Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.
Yes, I did.
Okay.
Please, have a seat.
She's very beautiful.
Yeah. You want a beer?
Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.
Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.
I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
No they're not.
Shut up!
I love you so much.
I'm sorry for everything.
Simulates?
That... was... no... simulation.
I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
Schwartz.
Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."
I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
Yessir.
You're insane.
I just wanted to say hi.  Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
Maxine.
I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
Good. Now we're getting somewhere.  Not a chance.
It better be.
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
Sure. It'd be fun.
You're evil, Maxine.
A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
Hello. Wendy.
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
Can I be anyone I want?
Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
A scary dream?
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
Do you?
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
Do we get to wear a crown?
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
Yes, Hi.
I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.
Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
Mr. Malkovich?
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
Lotte called me.
Really? Yeah. Okay.
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.
He's a selfish bastard.
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just...
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
Aye. Speak then if ye must.
But you said...you said out there, there ain't no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. No de-fense.
Then what do I do?
Folks come. Folks go.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
No, Stamp. I ain't.
Ah, winter in Ohio is especially rough if you've got an appetite for color.
You best leave that quilt alone. That was grandma's quilt.
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
NO. THEY TRIED ONCE BUT I STOPPED THEM. THEY WON'T EVER COME BACK...YOU MY BEST THING.
Baby, don't be like that.
Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
More than all right. Miss Bodwin, she teach me stuff..Book stuff. She says I might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting on me.
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
Yes sir
Oh.
Yes ma'am..
Ya think?
In case of what?
Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't good. I wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that. But you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it. All right?
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
Well, what can you do?
Extra?
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
That was fun.
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table.
Might see anything at all at 124.
I don't know him that well.
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
Her who?
You know she married Baby Suggs' boy.
I run him off.
He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere you look you see one.
Oh yeah. I got big plans.
What yard? When who-
Look - Denver be here in the day. I be here in the night. I'm a take care of you, you hear? Starting now.
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
Yes sir..You right about that. That's just what I come over to talk to him about. Just that..
Oh, man, don't say that..
No, man, nothing is fucked here--
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
Come and get it.
Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist.
My rug.
Walter, how--
Huh?
Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--
Where's your car, Dude?
Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.
Hey, is this him with Nancy?
Nancy's pretty good.
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
Color?
Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
What's your drink, Dude?
I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and--
Regrettably, it's true, standards have fallen in adult entertainment. It's video, Dude.  Now that we're competing with the amateurs, we can't afford to invest that little extra in story, production value, feeling.
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson".
Thank you.
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
The main guy, Dieter--
Well--yeah, I guess--
Delayed after-eff--
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact I don't want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself.
There's no fucking reason--here's my point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--
Walter, he peed on my rug--
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
What the fuck are you--
First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over the line!
You mean--beyond pacifism?
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
What if it's during a game?
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
It is a fucking game.  You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--
What the fuck is going on there?
Easy, Dude.
Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. You're being very unDude.  They'll call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--
Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--
C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back--
For Christ's sake, Dude.
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
But Walter--
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
Nihilists!  Jesus.
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
Is the car out front yours?
Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
You know this!
Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax-- YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell happened?
You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear.  All you needed was a sap to pin it on, and you'd just met me.  You thought, hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone the square community won't give a shit about.
Hey, cool it Walter.
Then what's...
Wha. . . Donny--
Walter--
It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
Shit!
...Us? DUDE
So no funny stuff.  Okay?
Right, Dude.
I understand sir.  Could you slide your shorts down please?
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
My wife is not the issue here. I hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame.  I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway. I can't solve your problems, sir, only you can.
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
Strong men also cry. . . Strong men also cry.
Where's the money, Lebowski?
I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS!
I said out.  Now.
Stay away from me, mister!
This is not Nam.  This is bowling. There are rules.
I came all the way down here same as you did.  Keep from gettin' killed. Happened to see those jarheads beatin' on a good collar--  Habla Ingles, Tomas?
We'll take 'em in the morning.
Survival.
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
Save it.  I don't want to hear your words.  Let's do this NOW!!!
What?
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
I don't understand.
Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure.  Reckless, quick to anger --  You said it yourself, Whistler.  Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards.  Where'd they get their intel?
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
So?
Not alone.
Getting your attention, Paco.
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
As scripted?  You've already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
Not that I'm in contact with.
Are we bringing home strays now?
You should've killed her, then.
Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
I don't buy it.
Maybe I don't see it that way.
You're wrong.
He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?
There is no cure.
What do you see here?
There are worse things than vampires out there.
You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.
You get used to the darkness.
Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
There's only one alternative to the serum.
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
Then what is it?
The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.
Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock --
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
You've been listening in the whole time?
I didn't. He was cruel enough to let me live.  Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by.
I'll take my chances.
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
My eye, is there something in my eye?
Trying to find the energy.
Sometimes. Where are we going?
Look, this is not my field of expertise. You seem stabilized, but why take any chances? Let's keep you overnight and have the Staff obstetrician do a follow-up tomorrow.
Mrs. Leavitt--
No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.
That's a joke?
It's like traveling back in time.
Domini. Domini Von Teer.
--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--
You sure?
What is <u>this</u>?
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
--fine, later, fine.
Yes.
--scared the living shit out of us.
--Cotter's--
I can't.
--no, you're not. You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me.
Why?
Yeah.
You have to go.
--no, I think they're all in there.
Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.
Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
I do.
What?
Yeah?
Still don't see it--
My room, asleep, last I checked.
--I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--
--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
Next time try putting on shoes--
--I don't know.
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
<u>What</u>--
No one ever comes here.
--who?
--turn the camera off--
--Graduate Thesis--
--a Wiccan--
I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
All I need--
--oh, Jesus--
--still go see the OB in the morning--
I thought all your equipment got stolen.
What're you nuts--
We're doing dusk-till-dawn taping of all the places where there've been alleged Blair Witch "sightings" --the Parr House, Coffin Rock, Tappy Creek.
See what turns up--which I guarantee will be nothing. Some of the rest of the party are more hopeful--
Rusty Parr had the right idea on child care.
You planning on sleeping out there?
Smells Like Teenage Spirit.
No. I don't think so.
--no.
There is something <u>there</u>--don't ask, just trust me.
He'll never know.
Still working on it.
No. Elly Kedward's not the problem here, I don't think. She was just a good old-fashioned white witch--
That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
Whatever.
I'm sorry.
--a <u>lot</u>.
I dunno it's anything. It's a name Anna's mentioned--from her dreams.
Or a blood blister--or a bruise.
You're needed here--keep watching--
Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
His daughter, for God's sake-- I need to know if he's heard from her this morning.
I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
What happened to my Dad??
I am?
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty...
See a guy.
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
Door's locked. Nothing there.
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
Abby... you all right?
I don't know. It's early... I love you.
...What do you mean?
I cleaned it all up, but that ain't important...
With your gun?...
Remy.
We don't seem to be communicating--
...Friday?
Lubbock?
...Hell.
Back where?
What do you mean...
How long did you watch her?
No. It just made them feel better.
Got a job for you.
It's not strictly legal.
I want you to go fishing.
Got something to show me first?
So it would seem.
Nah, I trust ya.
Right.
What.
What's the point?
Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.
What?
Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
I've seen a few.
Okay honey.
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
You want to see him too, right?
Then, shut up!
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
Jeffrey.
Nobody.
. I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
Then you got undressed.
Nothing. Are you alright?
No.
Yes.
See my nipples?
Yes, I like you.
There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
Don?. Are you in with them?
Whatiya mean?
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. It's opening me to a death.
Why are you here?  Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.
Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
No thanks. what does that mean?
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
There ya go.
That's too bad.
I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
I don't know. he moved away.
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
I don't know.
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
That sounds good.
Okay, okay. Bye.
No way. I'm about to blow up.
. Actually. I've been in twice.
I guess so. you want to help me watch Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow. with a camera.
Okay, Sandy.
You want to go talk to him?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
What is it?
Frank!!
No.
No Jeffrey!!
Hey Jeff.
uh uh.
This is it.
.Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store. maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
Do you want the car?
Alright.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
I'll get a coat for her.
You can change it if you want to.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Okay.
... Stop it Mike.
My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you.
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
You'll see for yourself.
You happy, baby?
Derek!
Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, I don't feel so well.
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
Baby, you didn't have to come.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
You're a fucking amateur!
I see.  How much?
We want some grass.
No.
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
We want some grass.
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear.
Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies.
Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
Yeah.  She told me.
You have your intrigues.  I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine months, I am free.  How much time do you have?
Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
Slow down, George.  Slow down.
I just got released five minutes ago.
What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
What the fuck is going on?  When did you get out of jail?
Try the back bedroom.
George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.
I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What happened to our dream?
Everything is not alright.  I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
Oh, I see.
Mom.
That's right.  Layaway.  Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
Actually, it was three.
With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my partner.  I do not do business without him.
Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.
Power?
Beautiful girls?
And Diego?
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
I'm going to California.
Tough spot.
Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
What about him?
Hello.
I don't think so.
Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
She did that before.
Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
Yeah, you will.  Of course.
I know.  Well, that's all I really wanted to say.  So, okay, then.
Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
I'll be here.
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
Who's the co-pilot?
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
What?
Who speaks Spanish?
Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
Fuck yeah.  I never seen nothing like it.  I'm fucking wasted.
Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just looking at it.
You know, he's got a point.  We're fucking Americans.  We stick out like sore thumbs.
The UN is far away, dear sir. It is easier to make oneself heard with bombs. If I were in their place, I would use bombs.
The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
Dien Bien Phu?
And those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win. Therefore, to be precise, I would now like to ask you a question: Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences.
I'll explain.
Then don't complain.
Sure ...
It's a question of habit ...
I think it'll be a success ...
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.
Fine, Charlie.  You familiar with the Marsh case?
Right now.  Guess who's been buying Coke from him for the last five and half years?
She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty slick.
Thanks, Mister D.
For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
What did he say about Miss Lawson?
We know Marsh had a head cold.   We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand.  The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time.  He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.
Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the scene?
Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
No.
It would be an added stress to his heart.
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
Then she's not as smart as I thought she was.  You've seen her in the depositions.  Tell me you don't have any doubts?
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
Back off, John.
I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
I have.
No.
A little after eleven.
No -- but I can get it for you.
Yes.
About a year and half ago.
We were lovers.
What did she say?
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
Well -- I realized that she wasn't interested in me.  She was just trying to get information out of me.
She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.
No.
No further questions.
That's all Dr. Paley.
That's enough.
Oriental medicine.
She suffers from severe menstrual cramps.
One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
No.
Yes.
We dated for about a month last year.
He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
Yes -- he did.
What changed?
No.
He video taped you.
You're lying.  Marsh was wearing a cast on the tape.  It was right before he went to Chicago and met Miss Lawson.  He dumped you for her, didn't he?
Yes.
Yes.
No.
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne?
What do you think I've got?  A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.
Why'd you come here?
And didn't Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover?
And she left shortly after that?
I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
No pain, no gain?
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
I know.
I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
Oh -- Well, they're different.
Hi.  It's Frank.
Andrew loved this old cabin.  He always dreamed about moving to Tahiti -- living in a hut and becoming a beach-bum.  I could never imagine myself doing that -- but somehow when he talked about it, he made it sound so alive - - so wonderful.  Soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the world and it's problems behind.  I wish he'd had a chance to do it.
I went out on the boat.
It's only the beginning.
Shoot him.
She's waiting in the conference room.
Is Mom yelling at you too?
I gotta go.  I'll call you later.
No, Your Honor.
I am relaxing.
I'm always open to learning new things.
Yeah -- but can she cook?
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
I'm not.
That's too bad.
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
Not even if they're a dork.  You should go by and see how he's feeling.
No -- never.
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
I said NO!
No. You can have them.
Mom's orders.
He's not coming.
Michael.
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
Sshhh. "After going through the safety deposit box, I'm sure you'll find you're way to this letter. It's hard to write this to my own children. I could let this die with the rest of me, I suppose.  But as one gets older, one fears subside. What becomes more and more important is to be known -- known for all that you were during this brief stay. Row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were. It's easy for a mother to love her children no matter what -- it's something that just happens. I don't know if it's as simple for children. You're all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong. But I thought it was important to give you that chance. To give you the opportunity to love me for all that I was..."
I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married.  At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
Yeah. But I thought she died.
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
I'll get right on it.
You want me to call the doctor?
Oh, that'll be nice.
Yeah.
That's it.
No. I was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom, but that can wait.  I just have to get my shoes.
After the divorce.
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?
Would you do me a favor and go to the truck? Inside that leather bag with the pockets is a package of lens cleaners. Would you grab me one?
Oh! You caught me.
No, I'm not.  I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just...  Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
And clean.
Much.
I think so.
I feel so embarrassed.
We got engaged.
No. I'll do them later.
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
No. But I love them just the same.
That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper.
I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
Yes! Hi.
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...
Why?
Near the church.
Because I already tried once.
You're right, you know. We don't have much time.
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
What about us? What about me?
Yeah. It could get better.
TO HELL WITH YOU!
Sure.
I can't sleep.
Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
What's her name?
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
Apparently just before her death.
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.
Well, close the fucking door by all means.  But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
So what the hell's the good news?
Yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king.
What the hell you talking about?
That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.
Let's get going.  Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here.
Yeah, there is a strange vibe here.
Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here.
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Wh-wh-whooo?
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
No.  Not...not you.  You I forgive.
I've got what I want.  Turn around baby, look at me.  Look at your man.
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
That's your dream, Homes.  Not mine.  I don't want to leave this street.  Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me.
No brother.  I wouldn'ta.  I never done a man - any man.  Let alone a brother like that.  Course, as you can see, no good deed goes unfucked.  Now the question is, if the good get fucked, what we got saved up for the bad?  You about to find out.
Then fuck it!!!
You said the vision, the images.  They're just that.  Just pictures.  They can't hurt you.  That's what you always said.
All the more reason I should be here.
Aren't you gonna do something about it?
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.
Okay, okay.  Listen:
I can't!
You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
Daddy?
Or you didn't know what to do with it.
You better hope not.  Cause it's like they say, four can keep a secret, if three are dead.
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
You was just doing your job.
Now you.
Shit, that was fast.
I'm on my way home.  Can you handle it yourself?
No more thoughts from your asses.  Or I will burn your asses and snort the ashes. Hear me?
It was just like in my head.
Whattaya think?  Can you picture it? Over there the bar, and in here -- the dance floor.
Just what army do you think the Colonel was in?  Everybody knows the whole chicken distribution network is owned by the Klan.  "Special recipe".  I'm telling you.  There's something in the batter. Say it makes a black man sterile.
No thanks.
Ours!
Evidence of what?
Two point one seventy-six.
Just admit it, Caesar.
All part of the business.
No shit.  Bianchinni hired you?  You know he's a good friend of mine. |Family, really.
Ummm ...  in the linen closet.
Why?
It was him.  I'm positive.
Caesar, this is crazy.
Don't tell him --
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.
I should have let him kill you.
Pretty good, sir.
It's all right, sir.
Where's the fucking money?
Five.
Lick me.
What?  They ain't there?
Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.
Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.
Yeah.
All right.
...  thank you.
That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.
Thanks.
He said you lost something.
I told Bianchinni I would take a look.  Is it that sink?
Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
Don't apologize, please.  I can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex.
They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it.
Almost five years.
So am I.
For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
What about that guy this morning?
Even though he knew about you?
For what?
That's why I need your help.  You said you were good.
To let it dry.
In his office.  I saw it this morning.
Johnnie?
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
Scotch, Glenlivet.  I remember that Caesar made a huge deal about it.
An accident.
Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.
I'm still here.
Hey.
Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves.
Caesar wants me to stay.
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
-- if we can get a clean shot --
You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone.
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
Jason...  They can't let you go...
It's a lot more stressful than I thought.
I know who sent you.  I don't know why.  I learned many, many things from the CIA.  <u>Many</u> things.  I learned the way they think.  Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not?
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
It's a little late for that.
Get me out of here.  <u>Please</u>.
You have blood on your pants.
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
-- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.
There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
That's it?  Is that it?
Looks familiar?
I don't remember any of this.
-- please -- Jason -- omigod --
-- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture --  -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
I didn't know this would happen.
-- how? --
Think I could rent a scooter?
-- here we go -- I found it --
That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?
All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
That's the only angle.
-- I'm on it --
Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
-- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and I don't know where! --
Where am I?
How did I get here?
No.
Uh - what? - I ...
Got there!
Mumble ... Tuttle ...
You don't have to sing it.
Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
No, no ... I did that...
Jack!
You sound worried.
Sorry. Nothing.  See you - I'm going to be late.
Even later.
You remember Alison?
Er, I knew you looked different.
I don't want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you.
What is it?
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
Yes. I'm impressed.
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
{baffled) I don't follow you.
What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
Shut up!
Information Adjustments.
If you say so.
Ah.
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Every day?
Cut it out, Sam.
Are you still following me?
Go away.
Yes.
C'mon. We've got to get out of here.
Where are you going?
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
What a BITCH!
Next of kin!
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.
You are good to me Sam.
I delivered it.
I did it for you.
It's what you wanted isn't it?
Sam Lowry.
Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
You haven't switched it on.
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
What is it?
Mother!
He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body?
There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...
I know, I know ...!
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
Thank you for calling Cen -
What? Who is this?
No, sir.
Ah yes, the lady is waiting.
Numero, trois.
Central Services.
It's all right, Terry, it's all right, everything's all right.
We'll be back.
What is it?
It's a 27B/6 of course.
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
On the house. You did me a favor. Check the corridor.
We are virgins.
I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it?
Got a beer?
I should be going. I just quit.
You're going to live.
You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.
What did you say?
John, play the Sinatra.
His heart's beating.
I know him. That's Noel.
I guess there's always a chance.
The first is always the best.
You never know.
Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
Yes.
Our Lady of Misery.
No.
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
I need to sit down a minute.
No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
I think the worst is over.
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
It's coming.
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.
You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank, just a little psychological first aid.
Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto.
Better bring it all.
Okay, whatta I do?
No shit.
What?
Relax, will you.
You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
Used to be my partner.
One more time!
No way!
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
Yeah.
Nice, Jane.
You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
What's wrong with it?
Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
I'll see you back at the hotel.
Yes.
No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
You want to start going over who they could have gotten?  They can't take on people like this for network news.  For God's sake.  What's going on?
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.
I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
I figured out exactly why it is I'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor...It's because if I do that well, they'll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better.  That's why.
Good.
I didn't know you were going with him.
Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
No.
I'm not kidding.
This is important to me.
Yes, I guess.  Yes.
Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all this...I grant you everything but give me this...he does personify everything you've been fighting against...And I'm in love with you.  How do you like that? -- I buried the lead.
Speaking.
Just tell me what's really going on.  I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
Wipe me out?
Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
It's been a while since you read the news -- I'll have somebody work with you.  Just on superficial performance things.
Move away from me.
What is she shooting?
Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds.
I liked it.  He's not afraid to be human.
And Bobbie says...
Bad manners.
That's okay.
What do you mean?  You're one of the few people in this town I can talk to.
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
It's not.
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
That actually goes on...
Hey?
We're working here!!  You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh...
'Really a lot appreciate it...'
Yes.
Billion.
Yeah?
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
Why, you need me for the story?
I like you as much as I can like anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.
Who?
No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
You fucking...
Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.
Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
Go ahead -- what?
I can't be.
Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
The way you were looking at me, I just went.
Uh-huh.
Oh yeah?
I'm going home!
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
Shh!
I'll pose any way you want.
He made a cat.
Well I can't say that Walter!  She's incomparable.  They're both great.
Here here...
Walter!  Jeez!
Every word...
Hm...
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
Why not?
Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
Well, it all depends, Leonard...
I know, man.
I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Right.  Ain't no body of work complete without some... nudes -
I didn't mean to.
I don't have another cat!
You want me to open a window or something?
These things take time Walter... but for now you've got to break out of this one...avenue you're on...
I can't talk right now.
No...look I'm busy...
Smack?
Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive!
You are?
Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
"Let them die, and by their miserable death become the clay in his hands, that he might form an ashtray or an ark -"
Yes, get rid of them...
I see the rewards of achievement have come your way.
Uh, I don't know.
Here here!
T-turned on?
If you see him.
Good night, Mrs. Swicker -
Well why don't you clean up this dump!
No... Not a boy...  Find out if they're dead.  And do something about that arm.  Honestly, I don't know how you made it through the Crusades.
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
What's with you?
Absolutely.  I see now the error of my mistake.
Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?
Amazing!
Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me.
Our own world, where we could live and grow beans.  Hundreds of beans.
It's the news, Buffy.
You were having a nightmare.
Nothing.  It was just a dream.
I do?  I guess I do.
Jeffrey.  Projectile vomit.
Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
It could happen.
Buffy.
Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.
I'll back that up.
I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
Besides, Oxnard sucks.
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
I should have known.
Benny was right.  You guys are all exactly the same.
Pretty shallow of you.
I'm glad you came.
I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.
Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart.
Get away from me!
We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
Like my homework.
) What do you think?
Yeah, whoops I came.
I know.  I like your little outfit.
Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
Wait!
You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
Yes.
Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
We wait for Robert to wake up.
Our purposes.
Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
But you enjoyed it, yes?
Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
A what?
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
Vampires of the world, beware.
I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
He knows who I am!
I was just scared is all.
How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
Thanks.
You're having a fling with him?
My parents have money...
Are we so strange?  So alien to you?  I've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste... it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect place to spread my empire.  Honestly, Eastern Europe was so dead, the Communists just drained the blood out of the place.  It's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this.... this Mecca of consumption.  The city of Angels.
Got that.
Throw it out.
Buffy?
Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --
I gotta bail.  You coming?
You want some punch?
Right!
Nice much.
Weird?  You mean like you hanging out with that homeless, Poke?  I saw you last night after the game.
Like you've got a grip.
Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine.  But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  I really do.
I don't think so.
I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
Just do what I say.  Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
Yes.  And so is birth.  Now look me in the eyes, Nuke--  You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
Nuke?!
Get over here.
You don't have to...
So am I.  Nuke, honey, we need to talk--
That's great!
Oh my...  Don't leave...
You're pulling your hips out.
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
I'm not a real batter.  I'm a woman.
He won't make love to me anymore.
I want you desperately!
I'm ready for a complicated man.
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
Yeah...you a witch?
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
He looks great, just great!
You got a live arm there.
Which one of us?
We gonna fuck or what?
You spit on me!
Beg me!
You're a cocksucker!
But he ain't seen my heat--
Well, I held it like an egg.
How?
You been in the Majors?
By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
Yep.  He really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  Musta gone 450 feet...damn...
It's time you started working on your interviews.
Boring.
I'm nervous--my old man's here.
What?
Fear and ignorance.
Crash, shut the door.
It's a damn easy thing to play with.
See ya at the yard, Meat.
Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
Ain't he warning up?
We're eight and sixteen.
Hello, Senator.
I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?!
He's lying.
Was I at that dinner?
...this check for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers.
But what happens when they do find out?
The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!
What do you propose?
Watch it, partner, watch it!
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
All right, take care.
Hello.
...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.
702 472 1862.
Well...
What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll -
Eight.
And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers.
What? Ho-  Hey, come here.
All right.
Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.
Hey.
What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes.  You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI.
No, I don't wanna come -
Yeah?
I lost control?
Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.
A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.
It's none of my business?
A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and I mean every little fuckin' thing too.
Practice enough this week, you prick?
Why?
What people?
Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
Yeah, she's here.
How do you do?
...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -
I...
That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
Nice to see you, Senator.
We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.
Call security.
She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money.
Good luck.
I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
All this stuff doesn't mean anything. Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life.
Okay, okay.
Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
We had a deal. Remember that?  He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave.
Hi, it's me.  Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
Would you knock it off, Sam?
What'd you have?
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
Who were you with?
...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
You get down here!
You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
Mr Rothstein.
Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.
You're firin' me?
A record of the arrests...
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission.
God! 
Get out of here.
You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
Well, I've been busy. 
Hey.
I understand.
Go get a bag, man.
...fuckin' jerk-off.
Hey!
If we let her get a few of her things we'll be out of your hair.
Now move along.
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
Carmine's gone.
We can't help him if -
For what?
What're you gonna do?
I'll tell him, Remo.
Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
Definitely the most important guy in this room.
I'll be right out.
Want me to take this for you? 
Am I right?
Mm, you want to steal it? 
I do.
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
Bye.
You did. You're right.
It's what you want?
But I saw something...
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
It means I got the money.
What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
Listen...
God, I'm telling you, they're out!
Why?
I took care of everybody.
But he never talked.
But, hey, what do they care, as long as I keep sendin' money back.
You should pay as fast as you collect, you know.
Go fuck yourself.
Oh, he ain't nobody.
They'll do it.
Yeah.
Dominick said they're in the motel?
Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here.
No, no, no, no!
Fuck you!
Ch-Charlie M!
Charlie M.
You sure?
No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
I'm sorry.
You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
Then do it the way you want.
Having a good time?
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
Crowd always buys it. What do we got?
This looks promising...
Yeah, all those women who went feline this afternoon...They're so ashamed now..
There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side.  Ooh, she has a dark side." Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night." If you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a "duality" conversation.
What's the matter?  What are you saying?
At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
I lied.
Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
It may be time to get the police involved...
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
I hate innocent bystanders.  Whine, whine, whine. Will he settle?
Resting Up?  Sorry Spooky, I've got to go with God on this one. I hate to think we're just in this for the money.  Garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. We're going out of Oasisburg on a win.
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
How could I forget. Mammoth--go pet the kitty.
Absolutely.
I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.
Just like a woman. You want out. You're out.
"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
Oh please, sir, one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?
You've seen me...
The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
What's the name of your child's best friend?
What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot.
I actually got some memory back last night.
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
Uh-huh..
Fine, fine, at a later date, I'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who's not the creep. But for now, I'm drilling inside your brains...I bring up the whole Catwoman thing for one reason.  I bit Captain God in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses--  "My grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender.."
Not too cool...
But I'm blind.
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
I don't see anybody in there but you.
Don't you have children?
I won't let him.  He belongs to me now.  Bye, sweetie.
That's all we need.  Better let me drive.
Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
Any trouble, we whip out our Treasury Department badges -- show them the wire I'm wearing and read them their rights.  Theo seizes the Krugerands as evidence. Naturally they start negotiating. Offer to give us up somebody else. And we listen.  Take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at Justice.  We pick up their passports -- escort them to their room and leave them all in the bathroom handcuffed to the plumbing.
I didn't hurt you.
This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like?
I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.
You could've killed us.
See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury.  On the job.
Any time you decide to let me in on it.
Bear right till the fire road ends.  It's not far.
Can you make him stop!
I'm the one they'd be looking for.
So Theo and Nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed.  A thing of beauty. Jesus, the shit you come up with!
Wait!  I hear her breathing now. There, she just picked it up again.
Will you relax?  This in no way affects our business.  Go on.
<u>You're</u> doing all the talk.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
We'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
You don't understand.
Will you let me explain!
They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
They gave me pills to make me sleep.  They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
My name is --
No -- nothing.
I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
Another minute.
What about the others?
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
They say my work is somewhat derivative.
She's gone --
It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
The one in Brentwood.
The City National on San Vincente.
Don't say that.
Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
When they first started questioning Jack -- he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me.  And they began beating him.  And I watched.  And I didn't feel anything ... What kind of a person am I?
Put the man back on.
I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.
Yes.
Why can't it be her?
I'm sorry.  You've thought this out better than I ever could.  I'm ready now.
Shit.  I'm sorry.
I thought it was inspired.
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
Do you have to point that?
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
Stop talking like that!
I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
We had a backup plan.  But I knew you'd come through for me.
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
That's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. I must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute.
I don't want it.
Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you.
I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.
Keep talking.
A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
Tell the lady to relax.  Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
Got a phone in that van?
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
Are you trying to panic the women?
She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
What are you planning to do when they got here?  They'll kill us. They'll kill Rachel.
If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
There's two police cars now.
I suppose you're in your taxi?
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
Take the Getty Center exit -- make a right onto Cisco.  It'll be a narrow winding road.  You can't miss the house.  It's a mansion built back in '29 -- Spanish -- boarded up since the quake.
I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
In your dreams.
Are you busting my chops or what?
Stay put!  I know my way around.
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Mind if I have a look?
Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.
Thanks.
Then why doesn't she?
Nice.
She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair.
Hi, Jimmy.
An excellent quality.
Who the fuck is he?
It's him, isn't it?
It's Dave.
Fucking mad!
No.
You know.
Like what?
Jesus.
The things a girl has to put up with.
Yes, please.
Tried to. Sit down, will you?
Tell me about him.
Like you're concerned.
Something I heard someone say once.
Yeah.
Where?
Don't call me that.
Do you care, Jimmy?
I said stop it.
Make it up to me, then.
Probably.
Only if you kiss me.
Not at all, honey.
I'm not sure.
More than that.
For me.
No! I'm going home...
I was trying to get out of something.
Prescription. For my condition.
I will be.
No.
Don't you want to kill me?
Stop it, Dil --
I like you, DIl
Whatever you say, Dil.
Fergus.
And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
The Metro.
As the man said, it's in my nature.
You know her, Jimmy?
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
That's wise, Tommy.
He's all right.
He's hot.
I know.
No way, Jude. I'm out.
And what if you don't?
Thanks.
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
And do you know why?
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
Should blow you away, you know that?
Just a girl.
My pleasure.
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
And you know the funny thing?
She's not my type.
No.
Absolutely not.
Don't I know it.
You could have said no.
Shouldn't take it personally.
Ever see hurling?
Best game in the world.
Shut up, would you?
Don't be so sure.
Having a pint in the Rock.
My special friend.
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?
Want you to do something, Fergus.
I told you not to talk that way --
How can I?
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
Me? No, I'm not good for much...
No.
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
You won't run.
People. They could be looking.
Thought you liked me, bitch.
Where are you, ol' buddy?
You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
First her husband, now her -- she hoodwinked you! She batted all them big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken! Here!  You want? Here -- it's yours!
What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
Don't you know I'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?
It's all right -- look.
Why do you think I brought you here?
Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
How do you think I got here?
No. The doctor said it would be bad for my -- thermostat.
Open up.
No -- last time I said "I love you, Alex."
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!
Here, give it to me.
Agent.
So that was it.
But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
Then whose is it? His or theirs?
Oh, I see.
Thanks very much.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
Agents.
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
Gratine, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
Oh. Then who's this one?
Agents.
I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.
Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
Okay -- up there.
You're out, Dyle -- right now!
But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
I met a man with sharp nails.
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
Alexander.
Yes, but we're divorced.
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
You did.
I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to have a treasure hunt.
Why?
A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon.
Alex --
I'm scared.
Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on?  What a nut.
How can I believe it when you don't even know who the killer is? I've got that right, haven't I? You don't know who did it.
Carson Dyle didn't have a brother.
Well!
What do you mean?
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
I'm afraid it is important.
Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one?
You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Flix -- are they for sale now?
And if it is?
You know I'd tell you if I had it.
Stop it!
I'm very confused.
A letter? May I see it?
It stands to reason you are telling the truth -- for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?
What should we give him?
We won! We won!
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
I'm Regina Lampert.
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is.
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
Charles is.
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
I don't know where to go.
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
The man and the woman are married --
Starting tonight?
How about once more around the park?
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
Good night.
I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.
The man you had the fight with.
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
I believe what he said.
Don't put yourself out.
No -- no, I'm don't.
Didn't Charles have any friends?
At least he knows how to behave at funerals.
I don't know.  But if this is a sample of American diplomacy I'm buying a fallout shelter.
Oh la vache!
We will separate -- you look over there.
Who invited you?
I never fucked Rod.
Daddy you scared me!
It won't happen again.
How much further?
I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
I thought you'd be pleased.
Run!
I like the idea of all the kids in one place. If it happens, just keep a man outside until you hear from me. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
You know where I can find her?
I don't give a fuck what your reasons are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside Otherwise, get a warrant.
What are you doing here?
What?
I knew you were a pervert. Always wearing those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon.
You know about that too?
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
He says he loves me.
You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
FINE. Are you?
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
I can't right now.
Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.
So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
I'm fine.
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
That's not why we broke up.
Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore.
Yes?
I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
Why not?
How could you?
The word is Mob.
Yes. He asked me to come over and talk to you.
His mother's side.
There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.
And she didn't?
They're tasty.
Maybe you better just drive me home.
What?
If sheep don't count.
Yes. Unfair to me.
EXT. ROAD - DAY.
Freezer in the back.
Art.
Why don't I--?
...ya?
...-er.
And if that Elvis shit...
You want cash?
...excuse me.  Can you fix this?
You'd better coast through...
Suppose you're gonna shoot me because you can't get service on my cell phone.
No, you gotta go to McGrud-...
Borrowed.
Hey.
Fine. 
No, no, no, no, no.  Keep goin'.
...-ed.
All right.
Kiss my ass!
 No...
You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--
  Oh, we're screwed, Night...
...we can make it.

Okay. 
Hey, hey!  Whoo!  Okay.
Oh, shit.
Come on.
...Pete!  Come on.
Come on.
...you crazy bastard.
Shit.  You gotta pass him. 
 

Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
These'll keep it cold.
...man!
Taking it down the hill.
What?


This river's fed by a glacier.  Willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees.
You're fucked, man.
...piece of shit was worth.
Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.
To tell you the truth, you didn't.
I mean, if that gun was...
Bring him down!



Forty-five seven!
Okay.
Whoo!
 
We got-...
Let's go!
They aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  Arlo. 
Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
Who had to put a gun to your head?
Thank you.
Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
Arlo, nobody's gonna believe us.
Yeah.

Listen, shithead!
...frozen!  So if you don't mind--!
Oh, my God.
...such is the price...of patriotism.
Hey!
I ain't got time to argue with you today, Andy.  But I can tell you this.  Takin' your truck pissed you off?
Mason, you have to take this...
I had no idea how powerful it was.

...-lem too?
What the hell's a sage?
He's the dude...
...on ice!  We've got Elvis on ice!
Thank you.
...owe you.
Are you crazy?!  Take the boat?!
...-tor Long.
I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
It's too...
Is that why you're here?  To blame...
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
Or I may be wrong.  The breeze could be gusting south.  That'd be Billings...
...Destry, Fair Oaks....
Nothing has changed, I assure you both. The Army still thinks we got Elvis.  They had a tactical withdrawal.  It's just those two amateurs now.  Do you really want to concede a hundred million dollars to them?
INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - NIGHT.
EXT. BRYNNER'S VAN - NIGHT.
INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/CAB - DAY.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
We're in.
...here!
...in Missoula.  All we need to do is get to Mason before anyone else does.
I'm Colonel Brynner, U.S. Special Operations Com-...
It's a hundred degrees...





Goddamn it, Ma-...
...ready before the morning crowd blows in.
There's something else too.
His I know.  Yours I don't have a clue.  But if it wasn't for you, I think he'd have drifted right on through this town.
Sir, we can't just let him get away with this!
What's going on, colonel?
Negative.  Negative.
Who's your suspect?
...-son.

Yeah.  Ten months we've been fishin' this river together.  We use the same equipment, more or less...
He's brains without ambition...
...is death.
...-to a simple thing like...
Some people might.
Everything will die, Mason.
Doctor.
...that the prey can bite back.
We don't have an hour.  We're already supposed to be shut down.
I got eight thousand yards. Radius is five...
...-son.
...Mason?
Forty-seven.
...tunnel!
Yeah.
What happened to Colonel Brynner?
...we're all gonna die in this...
Just go check the temperature.

INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY. 
INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
He must've had a damn arsenal in there.
So anyway, he says, 'whyn't you do what the Chinese do?'
That's right.
What?  Oh, damn near yes. Unless the animal's sick or something.  And the steam rising off it like that in the morning. That's life, Mr. Gittes. Life.
Where from?
Honest?
That's too bad.
Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
Yeah.
You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
Yeah. Do you remember the last time you talked to Mulwray?
If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
With her mother.
What is it?
Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
Curly, where's your car?
Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
I don't know...
Okay, you got yourself a boat.
You sure this is okay?
I get by.
Who?
No.
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
Didn't you call?
I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
I heard it was an accident.
Too late for what?
Shut up.  Go on.
Of course.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
A private investigator?
I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
I'll stop by.
Well, how much would you like?
How did you find out?
You mean you don't know where you were?
No reason.
More like other people putting their business in my nose.
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
What dam?
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
I gave everybody the night off.
Yeah.
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
...A flaw...
That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
She's not tied up!
You mean she just found out?
Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
Aren't you coming back with me?
...That's not what I meant.
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
...no...
Katherine.
She's my sister.
Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
Of course.
Hope so. He's working for us.
Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.  That's news.
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
Yes...
Si.
When it comes? What'd you tell him?
Drowned, too.
It's not completely dry.
Yeah.
Who?
But...
Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. Gittes.
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
When I find out who that phony bitch was.
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
She ran away?
...and turn into a piece of charcoal!!
So I can have these? 
Of course I knew your father. He was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. Always smiling. He looked like Clark Gable.
Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!! 
Too bad!
That's right, Modern Times.
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
Whatever you do, love it like you loved that projection booth of the Paradiso when you were little... 
I know. But take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example! I think about it a lot...How is it possible for...
Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
Who?
Don't be silly...I'm old.  Don't look at me like that, please.  Why'd you come back?
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
I'll never agree with you. Never, Elena.
It takes years to get there. And years to come back...Now go to bed, Toto, it's late.
Somebody stole it.
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
How are you, Mr. Thatcher?
The food is marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop I could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler.
Thais.
From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough.
I know.
We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
That's a long story.
Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
-  We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
You know why?  She was so -
Yes -
Who said anything about brooms?
September the ninth?
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Mr. Kane is finishing it.
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
I don't see what else you can do, Charles.  If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now.  I am interested in - well, Junior, for one thing.
Charlie, please don't -
I always like to see the funny side of things.  No sense crying when you don't have to.  And you're so funny.  Looking at you, I forget all about my toothache.
I've got a brush in the closet.  As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
You really don't know who I am?
Oh, me -
I work at Seligman's.
Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
Oh, no, that's all gone.
That's when you've got to fight them. That's when you've got to make them. That's -
Half past eleven.
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
Love!  You don't love anybody!  Me or anybody else!  You want to be loved - that's all you want!  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  Whatever you want - just name it and it's yours! Only love me!  Don't expect me to love you -
Susan, don't go!  Susan, please!
I'm going to be elected governor. And the first thing I'm going to do -
Mrs. Kane, I'm not asking you to believe me.  I'd like to show you -
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. They're -
Yes, sir -
Not my wife - not either of them.
It's been a tough day.
I'd like that.
Charlie -
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
- and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
Go ahead.
That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you -  Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
Why, Brad?
Brad, you are drunk.
I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is.
Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
That must have been love.
Sure.
There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
I wonder -  You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell?
Turn that thing off, will you?  It's driving me nuts!  What's Rosebud?
Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
You're the disturbance, pal! And here...  I'm buying some... what's this?... Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm no longer loitering. I'm a customer, a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers.
What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
I take it she likes the guy.
No, this is great.
It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
You two better quit it.
How like her.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
But you were.
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
Let me take you out tonight.
So what are you saying?
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
I'm not fooling around!  Who went back there?
Oh God...
Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there.
I can't say for certain until we get him back to the lab, but my guess is he was masturbating, his heart seized and he died. That's when the girl found him.  Something smells like shoe polish.
Yes.
So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?
Peptic ulcer.
Yeah.
Oooh! Navy Seals!
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
We get... what... twelve minutes of game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!!  I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
What do you two fight about?
Eight and a half?
Oh, my God.
Oh yeah.
You know what I just watched?
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
Blasphemy.
Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
Wait.
Each egg has to be perfect.
You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
Let's hear it.
The milkmaids?
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
Can you believe this?!
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
Gatorade.
"It's not like we're gonna sell out."
Yeah, right.
She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend.
Bible truth.
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
Yeah, but at what a price.
Reach what?
Listen to you.
I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
It's going to have to do for now, considering that it's my car that's up for request.  Can I help you?
What?
Exactly.
Living proof.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
This is my way of spitting water at life.
I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
Could be.
This life.
Why do I have this life?
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change.
I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
What time did you get to work today?
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
Same time. What about you?
You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
All right. Good luck with Veronica. If you want, I can talk to her, you know, and explain...
I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
THE GLADES MOTEL?
I don't think so.
See? You're ashamed. You know you're out of shape. Take my card.  I can help you tone that body up in no time. Get you on an aerobics and free-weights program.
Yeah.
Yeah?
No, she's getting married.
Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you.
A half hour.
I should start.
How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
I jacked the car up. All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on.
She's my girlfriend.
Meaning?
Actually, that's his night job.
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter.
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Who's defensive?  Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.
She called you, didn't she?
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
I touched a nerve.
Including you; yes.
You're a pig.
I love you. Don't feel sick.
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
I'm glad you've calmed down a bit.  Hi, Randal.
And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen.
...it isn't there. Yes.
If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
Randal...?
They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes.
I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
What?
WHAT?
You gotta hear him sing.  Olaf, "Berserker!"
I don't fucking know. What am I, his biographer?  Olaf, what part of Russia are you from?
Oh, I know. If I had to work here all day, I'd be bloated and out of shape, too.
Shit!  Don't take this the wrong way, but I used to fuck her.
Yeah!
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?
You're gonna be at John K's party?
You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
Where's the radio?
So, what do you see?
What usually eats a banana?
I need my bolt gun and an ice axe.
Qualen, glad you stuck around. There should be a few hundred cops looking to meet you.
Love's a killer, isn't it?
Look, I know--
If you want, do it.  I don't care.
Would you?
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
Give him the money.
Okay--I don't know about this.
Patience my love, patience.
Wait, I think I have them sighted.  What's the word, Frank?
After the funeral I just had to leave.
From one professional to another, of course.
Like I said, I can't turn it off.
He doesn't want my help.
I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
Can't do it.
How'd you get up here?
You got to go back now!
You know me, I'm a night person.
Call me sentimental.
Sure, just give it back when you're done.
Want me to lead?
We gotta get out and fire a flare.  It's the only chance!
Jess, c'mon...
We were going together before I ever let go of you.
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?
Never could save a thing.
No, he's gone.
There is.
I'm touched.  Kristel, check the chopper, let's go.
Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
Who's going with you?
<u>Negative</u>.  The winds are too high.  I'm going to ride out the storm here.  I'll take shelter in the Douglas Exhibition Shaft. Over and out.
There, what's that place?
I haven't even got on it yet.  Let's go, time to fetch.
Kill him when he gets down.
He can't be far away.  Find him. Go!
Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.
I told you, 50,000 possible keycode combinations, in fifteen second intervals.
Good morning, Walt.
Watch that... Do watch that, O Dim, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.
A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
Impossible... I don't believe it.
I've been cured.
I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
Of course. Food alright?
Thank you, sir.
Phoned some friends, sir?
Julian. This will be these people now. Alex gets up.
I... I'm very sorry, but I never open. I'm very sorry but I never open the door to strangers after dark.
Now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. Alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him.
No! No! Don't touch it. That's a very important work of art. What the bloody hell do you want?
How do you do, sir?
Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
Well, shall we get down to it?
To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir? Deltoid "playfully" grabs Alex's hair.
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
I did, sir.
Yes... well good to see you on the mend. I've kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now I've come to see you personally to see how you're getting along.
Oh, aye, aye.
Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
You're gonna be sick are you?
You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
Fair hair, sir.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Shut your bleedin' hole!!!
We're going to friends now, sir.
Well, that's good. I like to viddy the old films now and again.
But it was horrible.
I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.
Yes!!!
Yes!!!
Fine. Fine.
I just say what the other person would say?
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs.
Let me be sick... I want to get up. Get me something to be sick in... Stop the film... Please stop it... I can't stand it any more. Stop it please... please.
Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.
You have, my son.
Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
I take it you are referring to the Ludovico Technique?
That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.
Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
Dad... It's the treatment. More retching.
Four in this block, sir.
You got a deal.
Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
Bottega.
Just had one.
Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
It doesn't matter!  Just get out of the goddamn building...
In my office?
I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
Save me the grief.  Step out of the car, sir, and open the trunk.
You're kidding me.
I am a nice guy, Daniel.  With a job to do.  You know how it is.
I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
Then let's have it.
I'm sorry.
I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
Detective Sergeant Phil Heller.
This isn't our goddamn game!
And you came all the way down here to see me?
I've been calling and calling.
You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
Yesss, you are.  He's artistic.
Who the hell is this?
I was just tryin' to...to...
Jesus, what is with this guy?
Yeah, yeah, sorry...
Two minutes to get on Broadway. They're doing some roadwork around the bridge.  Eleven to get downtown.  Four to the Lower East Side.  Six to clear the roadwork.  One minute margin for error.  My math says twenty-four.
An apology.
I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense.
No shit.  Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head...
No-no, I-I shot him.  The bullets and the fall killed him.
With what?
How?
Lenny, my dispatcher.
I'm...what?  Sorry?
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
You mind?  I'm working here.
Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?
Oh, I'm captivated.
Jazz.
Don't start.
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
What happened?
I'm sorry.
I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...
Dmitri?
I don't get it.
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
I don't know.
One more.
What'd they do?
Slow down.
What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass.
Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
I can't promise you anything.
You bit someone's nose off?
Switch the charts.
Don't tell me you're naked back there.
Yeah.
That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
Nothing is easy.
Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye.  Hmm... Ahh...  Ooooo...
What is it with you and the space program?
I have no idea.
You're certifiable.
Flesh wound.  No big deal.
Um, coffee.  If that's okay?
Just five.  It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
Uh huh.
Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
What van?
Realized what?
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
Okay, I will.
I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
Jerry, I --
How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  John <u>Wilkes</u> Booth. Mark <u>David</u> Chapman.  Lee <u>Harvey</u> Oswald.
He gave it to me.
That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
What about you?
Now she tells me.
Then I can't be hurt anymore.
You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
I'm not sure what you mean.
A dog bit it.
It was my dog.  Let me ask you a question.  How long have you been acquainted with Jerry?
You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
Fine.  What the hell is going on?
It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
Yes, that's right.
Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
You do recognize it then?
I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
I don't understand.
Working.
This doesn't make sense.
I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
Wait --
Wasn't my idea.
It's his show for now.  Look, you want to get some dinner?  Inter- Agency cooperation and all?
And Jonas?
I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
What do you suggest?
What?
Yes, sir.
Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
Tell me.
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
No, thanks.
'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
No doubt.
If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
I don't understand.
... I can't believe they wouldn't take something as basic as our biological needs into account...
Good luck, David.
What would you have me say, David?
Kent, Kent for Chrissakes.  You must be Eleanor.
You want to classify prime numbers?
You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- !
If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then --
And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?
Because I can't.
I can't move any smaller.
But what do I say?
Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.
That's my scientist.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Many others.
If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  No offense.
Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
I'm going on staff at the N.S.F.  To work for Drumlin.
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
Ellie --
Peter.
That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
That's not faith, it's physics.  The second law of thermodynamics.
You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.
I don't follow.
It's getting late...
What if their answer is, 'Oh, that's easy.  A thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape, our population out of control, violent crime, no food... so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anit-social.  The weak.  The sick.  The unwanted.  And ever since we've been doing great.'
The final countdown.
I can't do this --
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
-- I don't know --
Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
Y'know what?  Fine.  I guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there's no quicker way to show them.
Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
But --
Git your shovel and git to work.
I've got this weak heart. Too much drinking, I guess. As soon as they find out about it, they'll probably send me someplace else.
I got two years.
No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.
Sure he's got kings but you still gotta call him.
Ram it in and break it off!
Git to work!
Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke.
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?
Fasten your flap! All you Newmeats gonna have to shape up fast and hard on this gang. We got rules here an' in order to learn them, you gotta keep your ears open and your mouths shut.
Tramp! Beautiful!
Wouldn't surprise me none.  Wicker Man says you got a hundred- twenny and some change in the Captain's safe and you got your five dollars pocket money... That'll buy you a whole fistfull of cards. You in or out?
Drag's been chain-ganging so long he's got a nose like a bloodhound.
I call.
Get away!
A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
He's gonna be awright.
I just always did like truck rides.
Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
You ol' sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn't have nothin' to worry about.
We ain't goin' nowhere.
On my own.
Why sure, Luke. I mean I didn't talk to them about that. But why not? They're reasonable, Luke. Hell, we only been gone a coupla hours.
Thass right. Just play it...
Your Luke's got more guts than brains.
Gettin' up, Carr.
All the bears gonna be walking today.
Kick a buck.
This is a big day for the guards. They get to remind us who's boss.
What did I do?
A little homeopathic cure for the willies.
Andy?  When a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'.  You look under the bad.  I'm three years old.  Call the prison.
I know.  Do come and meet your guest.
You've got a date right <u>here</u>, Andy. This has got to...
I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
You said, first, he was lying.  How do you know that, Doctor?
What first two murders.  We don't know about them here, do we?
You get me out first.
I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet.
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
No.  Not yet.
I think this is number three...
Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
Look in the crowd.  He liked to hang around and watch the cops at work...
He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man.
Bundy.  That's the last one in your speech...
I've got to go.  I've <u>got</u> to go.
He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.
Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe. I'll fix it...
Yes.  I have to go...
<u>What</u>?...
They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me... I liked it.
Someone broke into her place last night.  It wasn't connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so I haven't...
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
Because it's your job, that's all.
Who gives a fuck?  In all the years I never seen you cry.  You loved him.
Just horseshit luck.
I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
What about her arms?
Good.
The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
Give him <u>that</u>pompous son of a bitch.
I gotta have Ruben, and a...
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
We're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement...
Don't give me six years!  You never divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd you expect from M.J.?
Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?
Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.
She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
Yes. From Wendel. To celebrate, the license approval for our air-charter firm. I forgot to tell you.
Outside in the visitors, car park.
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
I work in the immigration department there.
Are we imagining it?
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
I live in my car. This is my workshop.
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
Yeah, and a dimple.
What?
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next  How are other things going?
All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
Then, you should call.
And the party?
You look beautiful.
No, no. They've got to be Puglia olives, packed in a light brine with a flavor that doesn't overpower the palate.
I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
Mom and I fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white.
Oh, no, of course not.
I ruined your wedding night.
Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
You've only known Jake a few months.
Paul could pop the question at any time.
Especially with a promotion in the offing.
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
I was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask.
Mom, please.
I've already made arrangements.
A deal's a deal.
There's a spider in my room.
It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
Green spot.
Letty.
I answered these questions last night.
No.
That must be really difficult.
You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.
Anything interesting.
I wasn't hungry.
And I'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos.
Exactly.
Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.
Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
Your family just met me.
I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
Not a one.
I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.
You like it?
I'll be forced to tickle you.
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
Coming.
I got worried. Are you OK?
Always the drugs.
I saw you talking to my Mom.
Why'd you tell?
Letty, please.
That's the best idea I've heard in a long time.
You should go.
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
Oh, ok.   Maybe.
Sure. Of course.
You just need to get more organized. L
Yes.
This has been really difficult, this whole thing. 
You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.
He's a patient here.
I heard about your friend.
I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
I think I've heard this speech before.
I do apologize.    A student had a crisis.
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
You're calling me on is phone?
You don't trust me?
-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family.
No thank you.
I will relay the particulars of our conversation to Mr. Maranzano.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.
He missed three weeks.
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
Yes.
I know they won't be home tonight.
If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.
Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
You want Zero to kill him?
I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
I think he's already figured that out.
It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
No.
Maybe if we gave the tapes back --
Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
Good idea.
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
It's me.
-- Did you set it up?
We had a deal.
-- Don't think. Okay?        You're not good at it.
Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
Okay boss.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
The Holiday Hotel.
I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem.
What is it you do, Sami?
This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.
How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.
Mr. Taylor?

God, I want to go home.
No!
Uh huh.
No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
Yeah, I dig him.
Feel free to correct him if you want.
Watch this.
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
Glenmorangie.
Thanks.
I don't remember.    I was drunk.
No.
It's not your fault.
-- Shut up! Don't you try to make me feel bad about this. You knew what would happen to you if you didn't pay. This is on your head, not mine.  Break his arm.
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
A little?
Wait!  I'm a friend!
This Jade Fox is a woman?
I'm just playing around.
Why are you still here?  You killed a policeman.  You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
Shut up!
He is my defeated foe!
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
Don't invite danger into your father's house.
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
You're too young to understand.
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
Kneel!
Then you have no use for the sword.
All right.  Hurry.  I will hold on as long as I can.
And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.
Let them look.
Jen...
It has.  How's business?
During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
Have you questioned him yet?
But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
But Wudan does not accept women.
I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself.  We'll keep our eyes open.  Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl.
To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.
What about you?
Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.
Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?
Shu Lien...
My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
That's good.  Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing.
A female criminal!  Now that's news!
Father!  Let me avenge my mother's death.
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
I'm buying.
This is special, darlin'.  Please?
You gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk.   that doughnut's chocolate you, know.
You don't say.
The venom of bad memories.  You were there; you saw her.  I saw you seeing her.
I'm sorry as hell, man.
Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it.
No.
I have to go.
In a better place.  I hope.
I went to see a friend of mine.
She's still dead.
I don't know you.
Murderer.
Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
You don't even remember...
T-Bird?
Yes.
Go away.
Whoa, hey, whoa.  Business.
Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
The night is young.
That's right.
I'll be fine.
Excuse me?
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
You what?
Really? I thought he said it all the time.
Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
You did?
A friend wrote me.
It's not really important.
That's a matter of opinion.
What? Another letter from your friend?
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
Doing what?
What?
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
Oh please.
Yes it does.
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
No.
I have feelings for you.
Yes.
Get off me.
Hi.
What are you saying?
I love you.
I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language.
Thanks.  Nice meeting you.
It was nothing.
Okay.
Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room.
You'd do that for me?
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
Well... not exactly.
Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
Well did you like it?
That's one way of looking at it.
How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
My mom? Don't call my mom.
Of course. I'm not a monster.
You promised to let me kiss you.
Some other time, Cecile.
Good night Cecile.
I know.
You do?
Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
Yummy.
Who told you?
Did you do everything I asked you to?
And you think she bought it?
I told you I don't know.
It's Kathryn.
That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.
Shut up and turn to page 64.
Shhh.
You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
But who will they turn to for help?
Yippy.
It was... Fantastic.
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
Excuse me?
What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
Not that it's any of your business but yes.
I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
You will be discreet about this?
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?!
Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
I need to talk to Annette.
Do you know where she is?
Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
It's really important.
We played backgammon?
Nope.
It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
What do you mean?
How?
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
Sometimes.
Are they nice?
But it's already come true.
All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
I forgot I had it on.
It's early yet.
I think I should.  3000W?
But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
She said something about that, Mrs. Reed  but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.
I live right here.
You'll see it when it's all lit and ready for you.
Yes, daddy.
Voices from an old dark house!
You're upset about me -- I made you fight --I hate for you to fight.
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
But there's no one here, darling.
Yes, darling.
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
Oh, thank you, Amy.
A merry Christmas to you, Amy.
You wanted to share this moment with me.
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong  warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
Oh, I suppose it was to the wind you sang, or maybe to the sun, or the clouds, or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden.
Will you come soon?
But she's such a nice lady.
Who is she?
Why hasn't he got a head?
Good.
Don't you hear it?
The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
Anybody could know that song.
I'll not see her, Barbara. I promise.
Good night...Barbara...
Go on -- out with you.
Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome.
I've changed a lot lately.
James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
At Victoria's Secret.
Good. Except for PMS.
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy.
Anything's better than Mark.
Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
And my bra finally fits again.
He wasn't wearing a ring. But you don't want to date a cop Frida. They're so blue collar.
Did you get rid of Mark?
Hide him.
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?
Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
Since when do you care?
You never say that.
Yeah right... You better go.
Your desk.
Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
Very well then. Is that all?
Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
Are you following me?
Okay, you busted me.
Interesting possibility.
No, my bite's a lot worse.
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
They do? Oh no...
No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf.
I knew you wouldn't believe me! Just go away. Go very far away!
Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
What about... those guys... I might have...
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
Yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. It only works if you're on good terms.
She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.
Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
We're just trying to figure out what happened.
We can just take this pillowcase.
You're some catch Lloyd.
Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed.
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?
Not really...
I don't know what you're talking about.
You are mistaken.
How could you have been so stupid?
Fine.
Im sorry...
It sure isn't the fun-fair.
What is going on?
A few days...  a few weeks  -  dunno, I can't remember.  Worse thing is, I never know if it will change back again...  Now, please leave me alone.
What is that door?
It must be a closet or something.
Then we must call the police.
Just let me sit here for a moment? Ill go soon, and stop bothering you.
You know something about me?
Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  That's all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills?
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
That's what people keep telling me.
I told you, I can't remember a thing!
Not that again...
Don't ask stupid questions.  Look at it.
We are...  living in their dreams...
Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
You're kidding?
Don't worry.
And we're going away for a holiday.
Oh, sure.  Remember the convention speech?
I mean,  if it's a problem...
No...
Well, maybe I am.  But you're fired.
Fine...
TilT we figure something out.
And...
Fine.
What do you mean, he's clean?
Clean.
You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady?
Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.
Bob...
He's only doing what you told him to.
He was only doing his job.
Don't do this.
I was gonna do something with Joan.
I'm not sure.
I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?
Choices?
I'm afraid so.
I'm not sure... I might have.
Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
'America isn't in what we say here tonight -- it's in the faces and the smiles of a Sunday afternoon...'  Hand on the heart...
'... It's in the gentle kindness of the family kitchen as we gather together when the sun goes down...'
It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
He's not.
Certainly.
What?
Really?
Oh... Kinda the same way.
No.
We'd like to hire you.
Yeah.
No.
Yeah, but Bob found me when I was stuck in Firearms and Tobacco...
That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?
Well...
Thanks, Duane.
I don't understand.
There's no mistake, Bill.   If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.
Mind if I sit down?
Home.
Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them.
Oh... Okay.
I'm not Bill Mitchell.
You find people jobs?
It was inspirational.
Yeah... Bedtime.
Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.
What?
It's nice.
Yeah... It could be fun.
Dammit...  I told them no mayo.  See - - I could veto this Simpson Garner thing, but I really don't want to do that...
Maybe. We'll have a little talk first. Then....maybe...I can help you out. String him up.
No. I didn't stop the infection in time. I know.  Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like Maria. I'll shoot him.
I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I dunno.
The tunnel.
Quiet!
I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.
It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on...
How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.
We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five.
Maybe.
We got a boat.
We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.
I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha ha...
Come on. Let's go.
The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much...food...as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there.
God....damn you, Rhodes!
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!!
Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and...
In the battle, sir.
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
Say Steve, where's your manners?  Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?
So don't goddam come!  Please.
Needs Chris!  Must have Chris!
I'll tell you later.
It's every bit as hard as they say. Unless you're a genius like Meeks.
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
So much the better.
Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles.  You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.
I'm not?
But...
All right!  I'm thinking!  "Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments; love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove."
what?!
Yeah, chemistry.  My father thought I should get ahead.
Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  All right?!
Are you kidding?  Don't be ridiculous.
It does?  What?
The pleasure is mine.
You say that over and over but you don't even know me!
Just like that?!  You just knew?
And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
Are you going with Chet?
I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  Do you understand?
That goes for all of you.  Now eat with your correct hands.
Meeks.
Oh, Captain, My Captain. Is there poetry in math?
Courtyard?
AHHHHHH!
A madman.
A... A  sweaty-toothed madman.
I don't know.
Yes sir.
But different.
I'll take him over mine.
Nothing.
I... I just don't want to come.
Found what?
Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
What is that supposed to mean?
You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
No?  What do you mean 'no'?
Maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother!  His birthday's always a big to-do.  The stupid thing is, I didn't even like the first one.
I'll come to the performance.
Yea, art thou there?
Yes.
We're going to die here! We're going to die!
I'll kill you!! I'll fucking kill you!! I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm not playin' around here!
I don't know what these things are ...all I know is...
You know what they say...the classics are eternal.
You're going to have to get a new one.
It ain't any better out there!
The thieves.
What are you people talking about?
You people...rich people...
With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
On the side!!
How do you know that?
If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
No...
I don't take orders at all.
You ain't giving the orders here!
So?
Why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?
I saw these guy perform...at Altmont ...you know that? They opened for the Stones...
You don't give a shit about anything do you?
Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
A passenger...
Hey! Come out here!
John...
'Cause grease monkey ain't in my job description dick head...
There ain't no thing here!! No thing!! There's you him and me!! Got it! You him and...
Yeah.
I know...
Hey Geraldine, let's eat!
What do you think, Sal? Jesus, you think we'd miss this?
It is too! Now you passed it!
You're full of shit.
Fuckin' A. It's gotta!
Yeah.
I know! I fuckin' know!
Where? Where is he?
What hospital is he in? Where?
No.
But you must come in.
But I insist.
But of course! Please make yourself comfortable. Perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar, or une petite glace, or --?
Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know.
I show you. Come. You come.  Linda have special, crazy fuck. That right?
Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants!
Oh. Fine.
Who's got the ammo?
Biederman!
Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.
Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
I don't know.
Fine. I'm fine. How are you?
Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.
Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.
Right here.
What?
I... No. You do this for money?
Who the hell knows!
This is horrible!
Right here.
There's Vince!
Huh?
Yeah.
The shot?
Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?
You got it.
It's ahead, Vince.
Forget Sal?
We what?
I'll pick the moment, Nick. The game goes on until I move. When I start shooting, go for the nearest guard and get his gun.
Merle... Hey, Merle, listen...  Why?
Watch it, shithead!
Then lemme have 'em.
No!!!?
Right.
That's my plan.
Nick. Hey. How's things?
I'm gonna stay here, Nick.
No.
Yeah!
In the timeless words of Squire Albert...
Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
Wade's here.
Your mother.
Prepare for a change in lifestyle.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
I remember what he looks like.  I can't forget.
Out of the room.
I'm not voting for you.
We have to talk.
It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
Kill me if you want.  Hard line me with that 'I ain't got nothing to lose' bullshit.  But you've got plenty to lose 'partner'.  You've got a family.  I'm giving you a chance to see them.  I kept in touch.  She never married. All these years.  Maybe she loves you.  I wouldn't know why.
Shut up!  Drop it.
Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---
Yes.
I'm not fond of television comedies.
My insurance won't cover it.
Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.
I'll be okay.
Yes, sir.
Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
Fire up that thing of yours and tell me all credit card trans- actions after eight o'clock.
...What are you talking about...?
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
What's your name?
From over the mountain --
We will --
Guess there will, if it says so.
No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.
Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
No. She's gone.
Some other time, Stevens.
You are afraid!
Oh, you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!
Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.
That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
Well, I'll be -- 
The seventh day of April --
I don't care.
Leave your tongue off of that!
I'm through with you.
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?
Not long -- now.
Morning, Jabez.
Headache -- Squire?
Camomile tea!
Selectman? Selectman of the village? Me?
Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
You want me to go around --
You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
Well -- yes --
You are not so sure that he'll come.
You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
Jabez!
Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.
I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now, I've made up my mind.
Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
It shows on your face.
Oh, for heaven's sake, leave me alone!
My son! Do you really think, Ma....
I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
It don't matter!
You'll be a father any minute now.
Very well, folks. I accept.
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet.
Are you, Mary?  Well, I guess I'm glad myself -- seeing as how you feel this way.  Party seems to be quite a success.  Lots of guests, anyhow.
I'll do my best, Mary.
She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
Why, you long-barreled, slab-sided, lantern- jawed, note-shaving crook, be off with you ...
Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
Just remember that when you sign for the tip.  They're paying for it, so don't be shy.
No, sir.
We must shut down the building.  Go wider --!
Hey, I negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast.  I can handle these clowns.  I want to talk to Hans.  Hans! Sprickenzie talk?
Tell me about it.
That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
What does he want?
Hey, business is business.  You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference?  To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.  Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
This is what this is about?  Out building project in Indonesia? Contrary to what you people think, we're going to develop that region... not 'exploit' it.
Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
Go fuck yourself.
The only thing left for them is the City Grid...  ...They may not do it.
It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
Oh, here it comes.  One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
Thanks...partner.
'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
-- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!
They jet's comin' out.  But don't let 'em off the ground.
Yeah.
Yes, I would.
Okay.
Well, how'll I get home?
He says he doesn't know.  Why don't you cook whatever's there?
Honey, send out for Kentucky fried chicken.  The baby, just open a bottle of prunes, and one of the beef.  The bottles are in the fridge.
Yeah, well I don't blame him.
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
I'm really shakey.
Yeah.  It was terrible.
You can't talk or do anything.  You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now.
But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank.
Why you going to Algeria?
God, Algeria!  Do you know there's a bunch of... they walk around there... God!  People walk around with masks and things on their heads.  They're a bunch of crazy people there.
I like that... yeah!
Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!
Look... who's on the phone?
Who's on the phone, now?  What do you mean... throw it on you?  You knew it, right?
All right!  He didn't do it.  All right?  Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that really changed them, huh?  Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?
He's scared.  It's crazy.  I never met anyone like him.  His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children.  His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable.  I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already!  But he did it.  I don't know why.  I thought it would help me, but it didn't.  I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things.
I'm afraid.
This is Detective Sergeant Moretti, asshole, we got you completely by the balls.  You don't believe me, I'm lookin' you right in the eye. Right now, I can see you...
I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
They're okay.
What do you want to know that for?
One word.  You won't find it in the phone book.
Calm down... look at this, look at him...!
What do you want?
Sonny, come on out!
I swear to God I had nothing to do with it ...
Is on its way ... The helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to Kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...
I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
We're bringing in your wife...
He's groggy, Sonny.  Let me get him on his feet and he'll call you back. 
Why didn't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street?
If he moves - blow his guts out... Cover him!
I can take care of that.
Gimme the traveler's checks and the register.
Give me the keys...
They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny.
The TV ... they want to talk to you ...
Special to me, too.
I'm sorry.
Yeah?
No.  I had some legal training, but...
Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.
What about Howard?
Girls, I wanta apologize.  For my language back there.
You were terrific, too!
Oh, a long time.  Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be?  He wasn't around here.  I thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.
Yeah - it's all right... let's go.
Dead or alive?
What kind of a deal?
... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say!
It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ...
Get over there!
Okay.
I'd like to work with you on this, not against you.
You follow my car. 
I am.
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
Sonny - Here's your document.
Yeah - it looks real official.
Oh.  Run.
Maybe...
Doing what?
Get a job doing what?  You gotta be a member of a union, no union card - no job.  To join the union, you gotta get the job, but you don't get the job without the card.
Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right?
How much you have to pay an entertainer to fill this slot?
<i>My theft insurance policy will have to fork over the ten million... but that will take six to eight months due to Nevada state law.</i>  <i>But you should know sir... that I employ bounty hunters. My bounty hunters can find these thieves.</i>

I fucked up. You can't help your greedy black lying ass from trying to get everything. All you've done is put a death sentence on Meeka.
Where is the money?
Chi-Chi!  CHI-CHI!
Yeah. <b> INT. FENDER HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER </b>
<i>Mescaline.</i> <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NIGHT </b> Domino and the others are all drinking coffee. Alf stares out through the windshield at the GLOW of Vegas in the distance.
He used to date Pat Benatar!
Domino. Do you have a last name... Domino?
No. What's the big deal?
Do you know where Danang is?
Just shut up and do what they say. They're gonna kill us if we don't, Ian.
In theory.
Nobody.
<i>The tough get going.</i>
Real fast.
I like 'em, but you don't play anything else.
My brother.
Excuse me.  I'm very sorry.
Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
Jade, I still love you.
No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.
I'm cool.  I'm cool.
Don't worry about it.  But when it happens and I'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either.
What was you saying?
Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?
Gotta go.
That's it?
Later.  Gotta get paid.
I'm in here.
See ya around.
Sorry, comb got caught.
And move to Long Island...
That's my name.
Can ya dig it?
Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that.
Naw, that's some stupid shit.  Now you know how I got that name.
Him no white.  Him no white.
Run it then.
Be off in a second.  Tina, I dedicated a record on Mister Seor Love Daddy's show to you.
Here, you gotta delivery.
No, just checking.
Quit bullshitting.
My salary.  Two-fifty.
Make dat money.  Get paid.
I can dig it.  It's gonna be HOT as a motherfucker.
I want you to spend some time with me.  I want you to try and make this relationship work.  If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
Come in then.
Meda.  Meda.
I love you.
Good.  Vito, you trust that Mook too much.  So does Pop.
Mookie is not to be trusted.  No Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  In the back.
Mookie, you're fucking up.
Since when do you know what's best for us?
I'm gonna kill somebody today.
Whaddup?
Good, make sure he don't jerk around.
Actually we have something for you.
... to the tune of "Only the Lonely" by Roy Orbison.
Depends how you define 'new'...
A field trip? Maybe I'll join you. See you tomorrow.
Come over around seven.
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
Are you kidding? I'll be down in a "I-crapped-my-pants."
I, uh... changed for dinner. I get dressed for all my meals. Except breakfast and bath-meal.  Boy, it's hot in here. Mind if I open a window?
Then what are we doing sitting around yapping? Let's eat!
Well la de da.
I don't follow.
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
No.
I know the type. Lives in the basement, smells like a sponge...
Yeah, he's a pirate.
What?
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
Don't look directly at him.
Oh, no. You're not gettin' me again.
HARRY, he can and he did. And now it's on like Donkey Kong.
Yeah, but we still haven't found any treasure.
Duh. The cool kids sit in the back of the bus. Here, every row is in the back. We're all cool!
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Well, I could go for a tall glass of polar bear milk right now.
Hey, where did you come from?
I bet you want your head scratched.
Yeah, that's why I asked.
Now it makes total sense why she didn't want him to know we were in his office the other night.
Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.
Maybe the pirate who buried this treasure chest made it. Put it on.
We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class.
That's it. Build him a float for the Thanksgiving Day parade!
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is a greater American than George Washington will ever be.
Damn! What are the odds?
Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
TURK, leave him alone.  You're coming too.
I'll talk to you later.
Do you want me to pet your head?
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
You know, "some". The fag stuff.
Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
Oh, go on.
Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
Me too. I'm almost there.
"My dream date with Principal Collins."
Duh. I'm in your class at school.
Uh-oh. Harry?
Thanks, Pop.
So miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears that you've snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a desk. Whose wearing the Coconut bra now?
Museum huh, haven't been there since my husband left me. I love art.
Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
You bet I left him, took the dog and we was history.
I don't think he'll smell anything - just make sure he takes the check. I've been through this a hundred times.
But we don't drink from the house do we.
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
And...?
No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
JESSICA. Are you sure?
Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
What does Leto say, Piter?
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord.
Nothing.
LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life.
That's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. See the spotters over it? They're watching for wormsign... the telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the surface, too Sire... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show... Looks like a good patch of spice.
Is this what you seek?
They said you were dead.  They said...
You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach...  I'm something different, something unexpected!  I'm a seed.  I am so much more...  You don't begin to know me...
Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
Always.
You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch!  Watch!
Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it!
I see the truth of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER  Could he be the one?... Maybe... but will he be ours to control?  You know when people speak the truth?
Those sounds could be imitated.
"Beg to differ?!"  Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank!
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
I have no next picture.
Yeah, it's gonna be a great picture! You'll love your character!  Bunny, Bela's here.  Look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites!  <u>I need transvestites</u>!
Ah, so I pull the strings!
But, I don't like horses.  Do I have to get on one?
Well... can't I play the romantic part?  I'm tired of always being the bad guy.  You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo!  I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl...
That's good.  I could use the money.
So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
They do?  Shoot.  There <u>must</u> be a way to get around that...
No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...
Nah.  This happens all the time...
Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
Eddie, you screwed up.
Once you're in it, it warms up.
I'm obsolete.  I have nothing to live for.  Tonight, I should die.  And you should come with me.
Formaldehyde.
Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!
That's great.  Let's do a take.
Eddie, how was I?
And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --
Rolling.
What do you mean?
I guessed.
Yeah.  It seems a little crazy, but sometimes <u>you just know</u>.  She's perfect for me.
Isn't he?
Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door.
Boris Karloff!?
You met Basil Rathbone!
Well maybe you're not studio kind of material.  Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.
I told you this was gonna happen.
I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here.  Say, who's the lug?
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
I understand you just moved here?
That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
Hmm.  Those sound kind of small.  Oh, here's one that looks good: Janet Lawton.  I'd sure like to play her.
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz.
Hruphh...?
Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
"Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
But I thought me and Dolores had something.
We're escaping!
It is when it works.  You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch?  "Kane."  The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame.  Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?
So you're not gonna make the movie?
Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
You can't talk that way about my movie.
Oh.  My condolences.
I am.  How's your father?
Well you tried --
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
The sun.
Hell, if I did, I wouldn't have any friends.
Who's Dr. Tom?
It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
Hey, don't blame me!  You didn't say anything about no motor when I was up on that ceiling!
Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
No you're not!  This marriage was never consummated.  I'm getting an annulment!
No! Do they show you having sex?
You're nuts.
This is real, Bananahead!
What?
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
No, uh...
I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby.
Yes?
Really? They were..
Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...
Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you.
Yes to me or yes to the coil?
Could've been a nurse?
Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.  Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie.
What's the matter?!
I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.
The doctor said you were having sex.
No.
It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
Welcome to work, Ed.
I hear the dog really liked him.
Really? You see, to me, you shouldn't have any trouble with men. There should be, like, a line behind you.
Dynamite.
So maybe this is my dynamite.
It's... okay
Can't we just --
I missed you.
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
Why?
What?
Shari...
No. Who?
Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... 
Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
Come on...
Come on.
What do we have to do?
So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number.
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
Me?! That's you!
A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.
No problema.  You want a picture?
No. Am I supposed to?
It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
What?... Why?
Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.
No.
Sure.
Good?
Yeah. Why?
Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles.
That's the point -- this could change things.
If they keep Ed on for one full month, he gets a balloon payment.
Some more make-up wouldn't do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out.
That was just talk!  Fantasy talk! What are you, nuts?  We talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything. I would never. . . I mean, I take very seriously our strict moral code.  The line you've crossed is... it's illegal and it's immoral.
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
Yeah?
But, they were there I counted 803 votes.
I didn't make a mistake. Every vote was there when you sac down
Thanks, Mr. M.
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
Right
You bet.
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
Yeah.  Okay.  well, good luck Tracy
Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy?  We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine.
If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"
Looks like today's your lucky day
That's enough, Tracy.  Quit while you're ahead, okay?  I'll handle this.  Could you ask Walt to come in?
Yeah.
Yes?
You'll be fine.
Okay, Jim. I understand.
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
Oh.
Dave.
We'll let it run awhile
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
Yeah.
Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
I also like bananas.
Larry, you just take it easy
I told you ... I can't. I just -- It doesn't feel right anymore, you know?
So?
It was Tammy I  That's who it was.
No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
Oh, yeah, sure.  Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when you're done*
Okay.  Great.  I feel good.
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
Yes.  But do you know?
It's Lynn.
You fuck for money.
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
Yeah.  But not for long.
Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
No.  Now.  You fucked him.
Call me Dudley.
Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing.
Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself
I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?
How'd you get them to retract?
What work?
You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?
Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
Look at a picture for me.
Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.
Which one are you and which one am I?
Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
Of course...
He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.
Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling.
I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.
Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
I know that, sir.  I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective.
All right, Ed.  Call Sergeant Vincennes.
Nothing.
Man, why're you talkin' about Larry?  His business is his business.
Gone.  Not a trace.
I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
The youngest applicant by eight years.
Answer yes or no.
Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
It's mine.  I'll make you my second in command.
We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.
<u>Really</u>?  Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis?
Just don't shoot me.
I want you to follow Bud White.
Bud White.  He sees us and we're dead.
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
Some reality.
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
You, me and White, huh?
Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
Sid, it's Vincennes.
Something good?
What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
Sid, how are they hanging?
What's wrong, Trash?
I just called it.
Maybe you bumped into someone who took it and you didn't even know.
Who are you calling?!
So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
Listen to me--
Do it!
Rachel Banks?
Really?
What do they have to do with this?
The NSA?
230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
And you won't. Now move--
If you find something, chalk the Baltimore Sheraton mailbox and go to Temperanceville. It's South of Salisbury.  And take this.
We said a hundred.
You told me no calls.
How'd you get around the tap orders?
What's going on?
You sure?
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
No he won't.
What about newspapers and magazines?
<u>I</u> know. <u>I</u> know what they're looking for and I'm telling you.
What if--
What if we just fucked with 'em?
No.
No, I want the NSA to get caught spying on Albert.
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
Are you sure about this?
You got any money?
I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a <u>little</u> about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.
I'll say.
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
I didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.
A report?
About what?
I'm no expert, but I'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused--
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
Yes sir.
Not a very good one, but--
Right.
The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
Yeah.
I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
Stacy--
Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the best time for the I-Told-You-So speech.
You opened the thing?
That's gonna end tonight.
Albert's gonna get me my job back.
Sir?
Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.
Oh.
It tastes like fish.
When do I get to meet him?
That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
Will you hang on just a second.
How?
We have good reason to believe that he passed you--
--otherwise we may have to--
Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
Gimme a week and four guys from litigation and I'll have the Post pleading with us not to sue for libel.
This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
Mr. Dean--
Really?
Alright!
The blender?
They only took electrical appliances.
Into what?
Rachel's dead?
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
To the cops?
Jerry?
Bobby--
How can I reach you?
What the hell does it mean?
We found the originals.
He's clever. He had help.
Sir--
I just meant--
The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
I'm sorry - what have you noticed?
Excuse me?
I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
Excuse me?
Her or me?
I thought you might paste them into your book.
No.
And the marriage - is that a fiction? 
Good.
You bastard, I was believing you!
Don't go over it again, please.
What?
You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
I know, darling, I'm sorry.
Don't talk.
There you have me.
I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
Sorry, what's your point?
I desperately need a jeep.  There's been an accident.
What?
No!  NO!  Don't radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep!
Her hands and feet were tied.
I looked at them.  They're shrubs, small trees.  Exquisite.  And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.
Cut the ropes.  I left a note, on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.
No.
I keep explaining.  You've got the wrong man.  My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini.  Bellini, Caravaggio, both painters, I think that is confusing you.
I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.
You were in Africa?
Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?
Some gave me a dress.  You know what's great?  What I'm learning? You win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground. Everywhere I go, we're in the right. I like that.
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
Please don't creep around this house.
Are you planning to be the exception?
Moose.
I don't know.  Paper.  Is it? Paper?  I don't remember.
What? Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
What?
And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
The rest meant nothing to me.
You can't kill me.  I died years ago.
Darling, for goodness' sake!
But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?
What?
Oh no, really.  She has her book.
Very much so.  We are all, save my friend here.
Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
Thank you.
Why?  Can he lay eggs?
Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
Sikh.  If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh.
We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
Yes, for your hair.
You get Hardy.
Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
I try not to expect you.
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier?
Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
A toddler
A bit of one.
Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.
Why not?
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.

No.  I think I was a pilot.  I was found near the wreckage of a plane by the Bedouin.  I was with them for some time.
Why?  Are you German?
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
I don't recall asking your permission.
You got a better idea?
Why didn't I think of that?
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
He's on to something bigger.
Who am I?
No you can't.
How about if you try disappearing.
Uh, yes.
So what?
It's not for sale.
It's only on exhibit at the Queen's Museum this month. Even if you could get into the museum, the Mask bas its own security system. A special, randomly programmed interval code.
Look on the back. What do you see?
That's what you're buying. Put it in your pocket.
Got it.
I never carry...baggage.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
You really don't believe I'd take on a partner after all these years without a little...insurance?
Good morning.
In a week.
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
Let's just see how we do.
We are...for the tools.
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
Thank you.
Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it.
Bookshelf. Sensors--
You're not on the beat.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
Yes. Yes.
There is no big job.
There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.
A parting gift from the Empire.
Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
Can't be too careful.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank.
We can't leave it IN THERE, it's got all our accounts, everything that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!!
I sincerely hope not.
No way.
But--
My god--
That would be Thibadeaux. The cop I work for every now and then. Catching thieves. The really good ones--the ones who imitate me.
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
You should know, when I come back here with the Mask--if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you've done goes to the PRC.
Next time I'll use valet parking.
Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.
It better be worth it for me.
The early bird gets the damn worm.
Remind me why.
Probably not.
Erin, you've been here three weeks.  If you don't know how to do your job by now, I am not about to do it for you.
Hey, excellent.  Thanks.
Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says.  And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
It's those files you asked for.
So you say.
It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
Well it oughta be, with all the work I put into it.
Right.
They did?
I thought the same thing, right off the bat. That's why we went to see the doctor.  But hunh-uh.  Turns out one's got nothing to do with the other.
Yeah.
Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
A number for the whole group, or for us?
... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
I told you the questions might get a little personal --
Yeah?  Well, fuck you.  Sorry doesn't feed my kids.
I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me.
I guess I'm not the right kind.
I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?
Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
So you think we got 'em scared?
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.
No shit.
Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
Show me the document that proves that.
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm ... fine.
It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
Erin --
Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
How do you know that?
The firm took in sixty.  That's three percent.  Seemed like a fair bonus to me.
Ross -- you are an absolute angel.
There's more than one kind?
Have you been to the water board?
I don't know.
I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".
Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.  Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it.  Does anyone know anything about these phones?
Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.
That's all you got, lady.  Two wrong feet. In fucking ugly shoes.
How?
Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.
No, see -- that's exactly what those arrogant PG&E fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power, we don't stand a chance in hell against them.  But you know what?  They're wrong.
Keep your voice down.
Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here.  Beth started talking.
Just a few more minutes, then we can go.  Take her, will you?
That is not what I'm --
I can't leave my job, George.
I need it.
We'll just be a minute.  Get a little more sleep.
I'm real sorry, Laura.
Have you been logging on?
Uh-huh?
Right, I guess those are the kids --
Well, if you're talking about contamination, you're getting out of my area of expertise. Let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at USC.
Don't go telling anyone.  It'll ruin my reputation.
And code the signal to my private chamber.
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
You are the last Jedi, Luke.  You are our only hope.  Be patient.
Ben ... Ben ...
I can help them!
Growls a reserved greeting.
We're not out of this yet.
Barks his right on!
Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great.
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
I'm going to see what it is.
Me?  I don't know what you mean.
And what are they, pray tell?
Forget it.
Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.
Probably an asteroid field ....
Now you're making sense.
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
Why?
Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
You mean a man you can control.
Try and control this ...
Where?
There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
No lightspeed?
Here ... near the Anoat system.
You keep logs?  My, how organized.
Let er go, Chewie.
It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.
I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.
Thanks to you.
I always said you were a gentleman.
I'm sorry too.
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
You may call me Leia.
Thanks.
There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.
What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...
Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.
His fate is sealed.  You'll be lucky to get out yourself.  All systems are on alert.  everything's locked.
I didn't say anything?
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
Han's leaving?
He'll survive.
Why not me?
You are reckless!
They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
Only what you take with you.
Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!
I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.
No!
I'll die first.
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
I should.  I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
Go on now. Do as I say.
You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your girl back, I got it all. Just for you, Cuervo. Just for you.
Where?
What?
What's in it for me?
Not anymore.
Don't lie to me.
If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
A medical team will be standing by.
Yeah, I got it.
Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
Who?
The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
What the hell is this?
Give me the prototype.
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
...Perceval!
I sought only not to harm you, sir.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
I gave up my castles and my lands!
I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.
But one can still keep a sword sharp riding out in the name of the King's law.
It is deep...
Speak of the devil!...
You are the son of King Uther, and the fair Igrayne... you are King Arthur.
In the great book.
Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
...to ride out and meet them.
Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay.
Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
So be it.
I don't know. Merlin brought you to me when you were newly born and charged me to raise you as my own. At first, I did so because I feared Merlin, later because I loved you.
Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
I cannot love as a woman the lady who will be wife to my King and my friend. And, in pledging my love to you, I cannot love any other woman.
--Nothing!
Twenty days!? The world is that big?
I'm not jealous!
People make you laugh?
Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
You strike me with words as hard as steel.
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
I don't know. No, not really I suppose. But I've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual.
You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...
Oh great, anything else?
Maybe the circuit is busy?
Well, when I went to get the Thorazine I had him to stay with her and... Oh, I should of known better.
Please.
What's her name?
Really? wow.
Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
I just heard them Karl.
She is going to be well?
What man?
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
And those lies she's been telling?
Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
No.
That depends.
Could you see her?
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
What else?
Are you sure?
No.
When can I have one?
I found it.
Here I'll show you.
You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
What?
But you like him.
Do you not like him like daddy?
Well I heard differently.
I don't know, I just thought.
Okay.
Why does God let us get tired?
That's his office back of St. Mike's. He's our psychiatric counsellor. He had a pretty rough knock last night poor guy, his mother passed away. She was living by herself and I guess she was dead a couple of days before they found her.
That's good.
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
Who's in it?
You might loosen the straps then.
In time.
Ego te abslovo.
La plume de ma tante.
Uoy era ohw.
I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested. So far, there seems to be three. She's convinced-
As it was in the begin is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
I've seen him.
Yeah, a fall.
Sick priest, is that it?
No I probably wouldn't.
Incidentally I mention only in passing that I could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession.
I've seen it.
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
O'Lord hear my prey.
Bastards! Stop!
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
Do you have an appointment?
Are you a relative?
Sometimes.
You're not going to drive.
No.
Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
Right, twelve years.  Couple times a month.
Baker.
Teeth.
How will he eat?
Catholics.  What do you expect? Oh, well, what's in a name, right? Let's go inside and have a look at that cake.
Wait.  Watch.  Here comes Dad.
Out.
Two nights.
What's the point?
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
You got weird kids, Frank.
Bosen black.  Flat.
It's more than that.
Nothing.  Everything's great. Terrific.
It's not family.  It's business.
Your doorbell doesn't work.
You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
I don't know what you mean.
I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
It's just an idea.  I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
You, Frank.  All these years you been telling me we're different.  We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us.
It never was.
I'll drop the eighths.
Come on, stand still.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
Here, how's this?
I'll take my chances.
You wanna get a drink?
Not true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic.
No, you take the right.
Okay.
Yeah.
Doesn't it matter to you?
Because I can hear it.
I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
What the hell are these?
How come I didn't hear anything?
Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.
He was just having fun.
You could've come.
The tenth's out.
You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
I don't know. Some disease.
A channel. It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?
It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.
Who's weak now, big brother?
No.
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
Yeah.
Five years ago.  November.
Just call me a cab.
All right.
Right.
Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my brother.
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
What's he talking about?
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
I was gonna split it with you guys.
Hey.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
Tell her.
Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.
Huh?
In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here.  So it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.
I just saw a man walk out of your room!
What?
Yes, well, they are.
Uh, well ...
I'll call you.
I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
You know, I'm feeling a lot of hostility from you.
He doesn't bite.
Frank works hard.
He leads, I follow.
It's been a long time, Ma.
Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway.
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?
Nothing personal --
Every year.
In and out.
Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.
Like a baby. You?
Hey, business is business.
I'm not upset.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
Who's Nina?
How come you didn't close your eyes?
Coffee?
Hi.
Thanks.  For letting me in last night.
What happened to the donut king?
Is that what you used to do?
What are they?
What's a prom?
Okay.  How'd yours go?
Merry Christmas.
Huh? Oh, no.
... Thanks.
Sorry, Admiral.  It wasn't mentioned in the job description.
Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
Of course he is ...  -- He's yours too.
Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.
Something good?
Must've been after we got engaged.
Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
Just make sure you're there.  On time.
You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
Of course I killed them, you DUMB FUCK.  And torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are.  Swallow this one, Commander. You are going to be in here for the rest of your life.
Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.
What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
I won't tell mom if you don't.
What happened?
What the fuck do you think happened?  Castor Troy just shot him!  What are you waiting for?  GO!
You better get used to it. That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?
No problem.
Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
Have fun at work.
They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?
So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ...
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
-- Studying.
Back then -- who wasn't?
Ooh, my suits are ready...
You?  Married?
No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?
Really. So youre projecting what, a tad over two million?
Whats going on here?
Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
Who did?
I think I could figure it out.
Sure.
Like what?
Is it...?
Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for gods sake!
Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please...
Ive got all the time in the world...
Cmon, Jack...
Its lovely...
Well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. Excuse me...
Look, I dont know whats going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
No, youre right.  What are we doing?
I dont know!  Please stop yelling at me!
Trust me on this Kate.  I really dont think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
But its twenty degrees outside...
That is the general idea, yes...
Its an unbelievable thing.  Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.  Im gonna buy it...
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.
Really.
Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  Whyd we ever leave?
Thats my piece.  I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.
Sorry, Jack.  Its too important to me.
Its good, right?
What...?
Whats the difference? Im taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
Okay...
And now...?
Its wonderful...
I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack...
Look, youre making this into something its not. This isnt a referendum on our lives, Kate. Its a step forward...  Dont you see?  Im talking about us finally having a life other people envy.
But Ive done some good things too, havent I?
Jack...God, its been so long...You look...
Dont worry about it, Jack...
Not with what they pay me...
What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
A shelter?!  Im the richest guy in the building...Ive got twice the square footage you have!
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
Youre a little tougher, Peter.
Thats easy. Youve seen my car.
Hey, are you okay?
I've got plenty of places to go.
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
Maybe its by the wardrobe boxes...
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in?
Ben, the money's not important.  We could <u>save lives</u>.
This makes five.
Yeah, nine years straight.
Oh, you remember my name do you?  You happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?
Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
Come on.  Let me buy you something to eat.  Looks like you could use the company.
And you can?  Power it up?
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
It's easy for you to be patient.
That's terrible news...
This place is deluxe.  You got cable?
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
<u>Girl</u>...?!
Dude.  That's my sister.
Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world.
Stable.  We're looking at low twenties.  It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
Reed, we're running out of time.
Not much.  We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
Which is precisely the <u>point</u>. Analysis is over.  It's time for <u>action</u>.  My men could have mass- produced this by now.
Never better.
It's been changed.
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.
We need to get past them.
Excuse me?
Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
And reverse the mutations --
No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look up.
Why didn't you say something?
You <u>need</u> a doctor.
A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party.
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
Victor, are you feeling alright?
Just <u>find</u> him.
It is.  There's something we need to talk about.  Something I need to ask you...
Phase Two.
I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.
It means killing Benes...  And for all we know, they may have completed the operation!  Damn it to hell!
What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
Tell him where he fits in, will you? I've got a few things to check out.
Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
Can't remember?... What do you mean?
I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
That's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.
But big enough for us...
No danger of an embolism. At our reduced scale, they're much too minute to prove fatal to Benes.
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
You may learn to like it.
Now I know...
Doctor -- is it possible? That we're seeing it happen before our eyes?
I feel much better now...
That's what they pay me for.
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:
Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!
Nothing -- against all that force.
Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
We have no alternative. With only six minutes left, we'll just barely make it.
Quite a piece of plumbing.
A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.
"Proclaiming in incandescent glory The myriad Mind of Man..."
Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --
If those Corpuscles can take on air, no reason why we can't.  All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when Benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.  How's that sound to you, Skipper?
Well, we better get on with it.
They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel.
You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
Why not? Because of his gibberish about GOd and the Soul? Camouflage -- that's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you! And to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes! And you made it possible!
Go ahead.
I'm married.
It should work -- theoretically. If it doesn't, the mission's off. The craft's nuclear-powered. Except for your wireless.
Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out.
We can get out through the Lab Section.
Could I run a tube through that Wall, without harming Benes?
Looks simple to operate.
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
Yeah, I just came in. I decided not to park here.
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
No Jean, no money!
Unghh... oh, geez...
Wuddya do?  Carl looks around.
I don't think so. It's nice.
Or your fucking wife, Jerry.
Whoa, Daddy.
Okay, Jerry. You're tasking us to perform this mission, but you, you won't, uh, you won't - aw, fuck it, let's take a look at that Ciera.
My wife! What the - how's -
What the heck d'ya mean?
Oh, geez.
The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?
Now we had a deal here! A deal's a deal!
Yah, but this TruCoat -
Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -
Oh, for Christ's sake, where's my goddamn checkbook. Let's get this over with.
End a April.
You have children?
Officer Olson.
I unnerstand.
Uh-huh - in what way?
So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
And what about the other fella?
Oh, yah?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yah!
They're gonna call, give me instructions for a drop. I'm supposed to have the money ready tomorrow.
You bet.
Look, Dad, there is no fucking way -
What... What is it all about?
My father-in-law, he's the owner.
...Brainerd?
We run a pretty tight ship here.
Ma'am, I answered your question.
That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
Things have changed. Circumstances, Jerry. Beyond the, uh... acts of God, force majeure..
Be back in a minute. If Stan calls you, just tell him I went to Embers. Oh, geez -
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man?
Well... I'm goin' ta bed now.
Whatcha watchin' there?
A heck of a lot. What'd you say you were gonna put there?
I know it's a lot.
Jean and Scotty never have to worry.
What kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
The heck d'ya mean?
Look, Jerry, you're not sellin' me a damn car. It's my show here.  That's that.
Mm.
I vouch for Grimsrud. Who's his buddy?
Nope.
Yah.
I'm fine - it's just morning sickness.
Yah?
Yah?
Oh, yah?
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame.
Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
Gotta go?
Well, how the heck are ya?
Just a Diet Coke.
No, I didn't...
No - I'm sorry! It's just - I been so lonely - then I saw you, and...
Anyone else residing there?
Margie Olmstead?
Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now.
Yah.
Still missing. We're looking.
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
They're real good.
Yah, ya think?
Three-cent stamp.
Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
Right, right.
I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
Really?  Great.  Still "Remaining Men Together?"
Yeah, both of us.
No, I wasn't aware...
What does that mean?
This is... really a shock...
Who do you think could've done this?
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
Sure.
A year?  How'd you manage that?
Really?
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
The girl had done her homework.
Let's not make a big thing out of it.
I suppose.
You haven't been going to yours.
I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
So you're staying in tonight?
What... ?
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
Goodbye.
Please.
Nothing.
No... no problem.
I could check your prostate.
Chloe's dead.
Hear what?
Have we been talking too long?  Must we change the subject?
That day you came over to my place to play doctor... what was going on there?
Marla, it's me.  Have we... have we ever had sex?
Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you...
You are an insane person.
Don't ask.
I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm fine...
Oh, yeah.
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
What?
Please return your seatbacks to their full upright and locked position.
... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
What do you want me to do?
Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do." -- And be a smug little shit about it?
The things you own, they end up owning you.
Do what you like.
Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
Yes, you can.
You're welcome.  But, I want you to do me one favor.
It's called a "changeover."  The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
In reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of Tyler's contribution...
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
This is crazy.
Like hell.  That counted.
Strange.
Call what off?
A generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need.
What car?
"I get cancer, and I kill Joe."
Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
If you could fight any celebrity?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
Yes, I promise.
Uh... nah...
Look at your hand.
I was going to my cave to find my power animal.
I don't know...
Nothing.  Do what you like.
Fucking sweet.
Tell him!
Imagine how he feels.
Hey.
Fight club was the beginning.  Now it's out of the basements and there's a name for it -- Project Mayhem.
You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
Wait a minute...
If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
This isn't possible...
What about Marla?
I'm going to...
Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew a hole in his head.  Was that part of your plan?
Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
It's out of our hands.  This is it.
Paraffin.
Why what?
You need me.
... no, no, no...
It's the only way to get rid of you...
You told me you'd say that.
Well, sir, you said you might.
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
You and your friend.
Please, God, no...
No, please, no, God, no!
How can you say that?  What kind of monster are you?
I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?
Should we knock?
Don't sweat it.  It's over.
That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimberly.
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy.
Of course not.  That would be irresponsible and unprofessional.
Evan Shaeffer's dead.  Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.
I'm Officer Burke.  I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.
Maybe.  What's this about?
Eighteen.  And it's "Hebrew".
The log truck...and everybody I guess. Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen, even before it did.
We have to tell her she's in danger!
Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die.  All of us!  I saw it!
I will, Dad.  Bye, luv you.
I love you too, Dad.  Goodnight.
I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
Easy, Billy, just open it.
Get out! Get out of the car!
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
You're the fuckin' devil.
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?
Oh, you've noticed it, too?
I know who you are.
Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?
In Death...
You saying Tod did kill himself?
WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
Huh?
No.
What just happened?
Show me how it operates.
You break your leg, I'll have to shoot you.
Read you.
Exactly.
There are no worse places.
Who cares?  Let's just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?
Powerful warrior.
Sometimes they do.  They're river pirates.  Opium runners.
I need a vacation.
You comin'?
Duck soup.
How much we got left in that minigun?
I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there.  Empty for years.
Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.
I couldn't get you in.
Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.
We just take pictures?
That's right.
It's not over.  You made one mistake.
American.  Come to get you out.
I could take it or leave it.
Yeah.  Big time.
But now it's free, right?
Well, I guess I'll come back then.
That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?
You threw him out?
Meeting ... people.
I don't understand you. What is the problem?
That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
Really?
Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.
I smell gas... Do you smell gas...
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
Okay.  ... I love you...
What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
The moron?
And who's Lydia?
Thank you very much.
<u>You</u> made coffee?... You're going back to work <u>and</u> you made coffee?... I love this!
"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
Then what do you want to stay with me for?
I... I... went to this bar... this very, ya know -- hard-to-get-in place... called Babbitt's...
Okay... I know but... I met this beautiful girl...
I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
I'm... just looking for Parry...
Where?  Maybe we can.
It was a crime.
Yeah?  Who is this?
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
I'm not...  Now, where are those shoes...
Parry... I'm Jack.
I don't know.
Can I take you to lunch?
WHO! WHO'S RUNNING?!! WHO HAVE WE BEEN CHASING!?? CAN I ASK THIS QUESTION NOW!!!
The Red Knight!
Buddy, the days of the debutantes are ... not what they used to be.
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
<u>Parry</u>!  Close your pants...
I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
<u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
OWW...MAN...
Got any Ethel Merman?
There isn't any more to tell.
You don't have to say that.
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
Listen, I'm not feeling well.
Shhh...
Twinky?
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
A wig?
Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
I got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the Indian Nation, didn' I tell you...
You can sing the song.
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?
I can't talk to you right now, leave me alone...
Where are you going?
It's just filthy. People are dirty. I think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. I think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... Oofh... Dirt...
Shut up.  You have bread, don't you, and a toaster of some kind?
No. How much do I owe you?
I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.
Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
Am I on TV?
Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.
Don't, then.
What?
I know.
Yeah, me, too...
A couple of months.
You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
What?
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.
None.
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
No, you're very good at it. I'm really impressed.
Is he?
I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary...
Catherine...
Just give me a chance, will you?
Thanks, Carl...
What?
It's all right. I'm fine.
I do eat slow as a bird, whereas Bobby can put it away like a speed swing...  Is there any ketchup around?
It is true.
Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
Hold onto this.
What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
And they picked up! I mean, it wouldn't be filthy, with Coke bottles and whiskey, and those signs everywhere...
There's some good things on it, though.
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
Oh, for pity's sake...
Why you have an attitude for?
So get the fuck outta here.
Then don't go out with me.
Is it true?
I'm wit' Carlos.
Nothin'.
I, umm, came to see you.
Nah, we make out and stuff.
I buy them flowers.
I kissed those girls.
I won't let my motha cut my hair.
She fucks it all up!
Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!
Eddie from Compost?
Which one?
No, c'mon, stop playin'. The girl that you kissed when we got there. Where s he live at?
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
Jus' from around the way.
Nah.
What goddamn right do you have to take him?
You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops.
My God, you're serious.
Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
Go ahead. Make my evening.
I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in Rio.
That's Babar.
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
I don't know. I don't have any.
Oh, he was dying for years.
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
Just relax....
Just relax.
Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.
Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.
Nothing. They're still there.
Yes, right away.
My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
Harry S. Truman?
Well, I'm fully covered.
Yes. Where you from, Harry?
Velma.
Check.
Where are you going?
Hi Gummy. Hows the eye?
Nugent. Ted Nugent.
Charmed.
I'm all ears.
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?
They serve dinner on the flight?
You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
You doing a story on this guy?
You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.
How long have they been married?
No, thank you.
It's Scotch-Rumanian.
So were my parents.
Preoccupied with what?
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
God...
No. He was. I got him out.
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
I think you should call me Gail, now.
So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
That's what I want to know.
How do you know about that?
But I've seen the deed.
Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
I'll take you to a game.
Bastard.
Cabana one.
Very good, sir.
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
I'm her cousin.
...never reads the paper...
I don't know.  Look!
Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank. Why don't you read it tomorrow?
You were going to can me, right?
My secretary.
Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here... I'm a new member.
John!
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
Of course.
But I ain't got you...
So you...
I'll do my best.
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
Right away!
Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
No prob...
Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
Exactly.
Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?
Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.
Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.
Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place.
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
Peachy.
It's Spunk Lewis, the lead singer for Dead Ribbit!  Mr. Bus Driver, stop!
How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.
Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
Ye-ah.  Sure.
Zuzu, be quiet.  Put in Colleen's disc.  Number two.
But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
Ye-ah.
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.
I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... <u>hey</u>!  Get that stick out of your mouth.  These things are killers, man.  Don't you go to school, listen to Smokey the Bear and all that...
Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
Jesus, how could you be so stupid?  Come on, we're going to a hospital.
Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
Who's my real father, man?
Shut the heck up... Pop.
Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
I was just discussing this whole Vomit thing with my friend Art Mooney.  Do you know him?
Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
Are you okay?
Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --
What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
You're a poet and didn't know it.
That's funny, you're cute.
I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
It is to us!  It's computerised.
Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
Doyle.
Boca?
I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
It is waiting for you in the garage.
Goodbye.
Who's this --
Avec a tu pourras le supporter.
Pour moi?
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
J'ai pas confiance en lui.
But will they?
What difference does it make? We'll be out of the country Friday.
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
Fake it.
Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
Where from?
Yeh?  Who else?
Willie Mays.
I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.
Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
Morning.  Sometime.
The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him down at the subway at Times Square. What the hell's goin' on?  I make him coming right out of the hotel free as a bird.  Not a soul awake.
How about that time you were picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Policy man in Queens.
Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.
There's about a hundred years' parole time in there night or day.
I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.
I can't.
This is my case.  Get these guys off my back and let me handle it.
Hiya, Jesus.
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
Why is it called Hellgate?
I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
Nicky Moore.  Patty Ryan.  Mary Finelli. These names mean anything to you, asshole?  Julia Sullivan!  She mean anything?  She means something to me!
Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
Baltimore?
Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.
Then fuckin' find it.  I'm going for the girl.
Wish you weren't.
Daddy, I'm scared.
Wait...
Queens, New York.
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
Huh?
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
I don't know.
I'm thirty-five years old.
Yeah...I think so.
It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
Yeah.  I'm okay.  What about you?  I want to know.  About you.  And your mom.
Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
Something happened, something...
She's not here.
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.
They'll question her.  Whatever they tell her could change what happens.  No, I want you to follow her.  See if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her.  When they do, you call the cops.
We're okay...we're good, Dad.
Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
H-hi.
I'm right here, Dad.
No.
What?
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
Whoa, I just...I just...
Gordo, I wasn't dreaming.  I talked to him, it was real.
This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
Uh, huh.
Yeah.  Sure.
I try to be.
Glad you did.  Come on in.  Buy you a cup of coffee?
Talk about dumb luck.  Odds of anybody finding that girl, thirty years later. And then the chances of hitting a dental...forget about it.  Bets part is she's the first victim.  She knew the doer.  I'm betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking.
You have the right to remain silent.  If you give up that right...
I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
I found this today.  There were other pieces of the body lying there, but I believe "he" wanted me to have this...
"He" wanted me to warn you.  Look at this, all of you!
Cool it, Andy.
No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
We haven't looked in the barn, yet.  Let's take a look.
What?
Sure.
Yes, man!
Will you come with me?
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
Somebody was in here.
No.  I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs.
It's deceiving.
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
You promised you'd never ask me.
Stick around and you'll see.
Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
Go out and plug the cord back in.
I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
Why?
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
Happy Friday the 13th.
He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.
It's just beginning.
Come and get it.
I hope so.
We'll scare 'em right back.
All the little kids arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone.
Yeah, we're here.
I got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them.
Yes.
N...nothing.
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
Okay.
That's what I'd like to know.
Sorry.
Okay.
He was dead.  He had to be dead...
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
About what?
My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
Hear what?
And you'll never do it again.
No.
It's...dead.
She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
We have to get off this ship!!
And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
Walking corpses are not real!
She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you.  Has he brought it back on course yet?
He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!
I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
I was only trying to teach you. But I pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your life.
Yeah...a lot.
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
But I didn't get you one...
What do you mean???
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
This is a great young out-of-work actress.
It's over, finished and done with.
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
What was it like?
I don't have the problems that artists have.
No, we're not.
`The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
She was very evasive.
Yes. What are you implying?
Did you see the winning run score?
This could be it.
This could be it.
We don't even like each other, do we?
It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
Why do you need a radio?
There's nothing left for me to lie about.
Packs an emotional wallop.
A flat-out hit.
Yes.
Two-all after six.
Who the hell cares?
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
She's my gynecologist.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
Life is good.
Washed away.
Pop, will you let me in?
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
That's my cousin, Angelo.
I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
No. They're not your team. They're my team.
hat was this morning.
Sidney.
I was educated by nuns.
But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
Burnt sienna.
We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
What?
I hear good things about the new play.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
Our Steven not only disguises himself.
Are you sure?
Mr. Khan said they called you brave.
In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
"I will follow you in all our vows and duties."
Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.  That I find hard to bear -- even in prison.
Nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man.
Well, we shall try.
Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way. I'm far too modest for such a display.
It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
It was one incident.
He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
A great deal.
You should ride the pony. It is not necessary to walk to prove the point.
Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master.
That's young Nehru. He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! Wave! -- he may amount to something.
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
Well, I've called you here because I've had a chance to see the new legislation. It's exactly what was rumored. Arrest without warrant. Automatic imprisonment for possession of materials considered seditious...
I can. But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less "holy" than Mr. Baker.
No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.
My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done.
Who's leading them?
Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
I'll see what I can do.
No, <i>this</i> is your man.
So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
This <i>is</i> the most likely location--
Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.
With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.
I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
What a relief.
This time I will supervise each test personally.
Six one.
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
You don't know what a relief it is not to be me.  Are you sure <i>you</i> want the job?
And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
Any particular reason?
What are you talking about?
Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
I'm sure I could have.
Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
Not bad, Jerome.
Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
In case you get back before I do.
How do I square the accident?
That's the hair color in his profile?
I'd have to bleach my hair.
I was at home.
I guess somebody beat me to it.
But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  How perfect does your child have to be?
That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.
Not so long--just once around the sun.
Not like <i>this</i> one.
Beynon.
And you got him...
You know, you and I may be two of a kind.
Get it over with...
I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.
Small town, small bank, big money.
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
Really.
Is he straight?
If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
I see it...
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
There wasn't any way to explain it.
I can handle it.
Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
No scars.
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
Oh, Jesus... how?
I'll be ready.
If they are not here, he must have sent them away.
Get your clothes on, move your butt.
Where do we go from here?
We walk.
Oh my God.
Might try that.
Where?
Wire pull over?
Just fine.
Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up. 'Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is.
You serious?
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
How about twenty thousand?
I'll tell you when.
How?
When did you find out?
Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
Was the steering faulty?
Jack, you're wrong.
I can't Jack. How can I?
On the Durham Road. The Pantiles.
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
I can't.
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both!  He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street,  I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday.  He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do.
It's the truth.
No, do you really?
While he was here. You went about together?
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
No. I didn't know that.
Of course. Where else?
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
We're there now.
Brumby.
He won't. He thinks I'm simple.
Especially when I play the lead.
What girl?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Expect so.
No.
They said he was drunk.
Yes.
Did you work with him, Keith?
Good lad.
Yeah.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right.
Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
What am I supposed to do?  I don't know where they've taken him. Do you?
And that'll make me feel better?
How could I stay away?
Jack Carter.
No, I didn't know that.
That's all right, Eric.
You should have told me who you were working for.
Not till I'm dead, Eric.
Piss off, Ray.
Yep.
The gun he means.
Shut up.
They do that up North.
Ask Jack. It's his old stamping ground.
That's right, Harry.
That's right.
No.
Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
Where am I going to work?
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
Eh?
For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
With River Oaks?
What act?
Men come work for you...
They...
What?
Yes.
No.  What do you mean?  Have I talked to him about this?
We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
Yes.
That's right.  It's a crime.  It is a crime.  It's also very safe.
What did he say?
Is that what I said?
He would take you on.  Yes.
What?
They'll know when you go over to Graff...
Yes.
Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
That's none of your fucking business...
Is that what I just said?
Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
Yes.
How ya doing?
I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
What?  You can't do any what?
...what am I going to do all month...
Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.
No.
Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
No.
Where did Moss...?  I...
Fuck.  I had them on River Glen.
You...
We had a robbery. 
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
'Cause, you know, 'cause they weren't, I know that Mitch and Murray uh...
Go to lunch, will you...
How the fuck do I know?  What...talk to me.
Get in the goddamn room.
Roma.
Murray...
You know what those leads cost?
Murray said...
The...Shelly?  The hot leads are assigned according to the board.  During the contest. Period.  Anyone who beats fifty per...
...apart from the top men on the contest board.
You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
I can't do it, Shel.
Not lately you can't...
No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
Good.  Now we're talking.
I have to go... 
I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
What?
Well, hadn't it?
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
Who kept the other half?
I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.
Only the beginning...
Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
Because I don't like you.
"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
Fuck is that supposed to mean?
That's right.
They took the phones...
He's right, Williamson.
The hell with him.  We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
Which...
No, his wife is.
Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
Kenilworth.
I'm coming, Ray...what a day!  I'll call you this evening, Jim.  I'm sorry you had to come in...Monday, lunch.
Mm.
I think I'd better stay here for a while.
I'm not.
We're going to speak to her.
Where are you going...?  This is me...This is Ricky, Jim.  Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.  You understand?  This is me.  Something upset you.  Sit down, now sit down.  You tell me what it is.  Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am.  Sit down.  Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside.  It's...no, sit down...Now talk to me.
I...
The power to negotiate.
She told me not to talk to you.
It's nothing.
Fuck the Machine.
Yeah.  He closed a deal.
Guess who?
They didn't get my contracts.
Did they...
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
Yes.
'Cause I don't have to eat this month.  No.  Okay.  Give 'em to me...  Fucking Mitch and Murray going to shit a br...what am I going to do all...
Three.
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
If you like, why not give me fifty dollars each to pay Fanucci.  I guarantee he will accept that amount from me.
 He's going to kill Fanucci.
This is swell.  Where's Michael? I've got things to get straight with him and I can't wait on line.
Connie.
I saw him with you.
Michael...
You're not my father!
Because I need MONEY!
It was my father's money; and I'm entitled to what I need.  Where is Tom Hagen?
Tom is right.
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
A hundred years...it's a toast.
I'm getting out of here I said; these guys all have guns!
No, Dad.
He will be a man, and then he will come for revenge.
Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey, what's with the food?  Some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver. 'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker with chopped liver.' Go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or I'll send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners!
That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about.  What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?
Mio fratello.
I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
But, you told me yourself...
What is it?  Can I help?
We have time.
And you believed that story.
It's the way Pop wanted it.
Chi?
You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
Yes.
But if you're wrong...
No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.
Wait... there's something else.
I don't know.
I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.
He's going to try Panama...
The room has a bug in it.
Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The little guys got knocked off.  If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.
Do you gamble?
Very well.
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
The witness is excused; take him out.
Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.
Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli?
Who do you think you're talking to?
Get out of my hotel.
Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?
Your family?  How can you ever lose your family?
Yes.
The incident of the other night is a nuisance that I can take care of. I came to you because I want nothing to affect our agreement; I wanted to clear everything I'm going to do with you, just in case.
It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.
I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?
So?
Sure, I remember Tom from the old days.
No.
I do not.
You were unfair with them.
Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
They feel cheated.
I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?
Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you?
I was just going to contact you, Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' - in fact, I just come from there.
Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.
I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
And?
Sitting right behind you.
We worked it all out beforehand.
My lawyer went over this beforehand.
We got friends in the commission.
How much more a month?
What was that?
It means it's too cold to go swimming.  And I don't mean the water.
You liked it too.
I'm not a kid.
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
Why?
No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?
Well...no, not really --
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.
We have his note.
But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
Just that I was in the Marines.
No.  Iced tea's fine.
What?  Oh yes.
They were familiar when I painted them.  That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago.  And that's a Rembrandt.
This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.
Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
You mean, like posed for pictures?
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
I'm not wearing an undershirt.
All right already.  I'll take it off.  Kind of warm in here anyway.
Your family ate dripping?
What?
Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
You don't think of me that way, do you?
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
It will only make you self-conscious.  You'll have to remove your shirt.
But we have to match the other sketch.
I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.
I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
I'd like to sit for you again.  But only if you ease up on the locker room talk.  Okay?
No, my dear.  The Crimean War. What do you think?  The Great War. You had a Good War, while we had --
You don't want me to sit for you anymore?
Do I look okay?
Nothing of importance.  Just two old men slapping each other with lilies.  Shall we have a drink?
Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.
No.  Definitely not.
The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster.
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
I see.
I'm very sorry.
Not at all.
I don't recall.  Memories of the war, perhaps.
Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
You survived it.  It can't hurt you now.  It's no good to dig it up.
What won't do?
What did you expect?  Bronze?
For the artistic effect.  The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask.  It's quite striking.
There are straps in back.
Oh, but you feel good, Clayton.
No, I don't want to die alone.  But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable.  They say you never see the one with your name on it.  But I want to see death coming at me.  I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face.  Your face.  Think, Clayton.  You'd be my second Monster.  Almost as famous as the first.  It would be the great adventure you've yearned for. A war story for both of us to share.
Fuck off!
Ooooh.
Good.  Fine.
I wanted to be alert for your visit today.  Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
Then who did?
So what do I do?
In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper.
Bring a mirror.  Let the Bride feast upon her visage.
Nonsense, my dear.  You look extraordinary.  Today's script.  Quick.  And a pencil.
Elsa?
But you appear quite fresh, my dear.
Oh dear.
Bone?  Boom?  Something Bee.  I hire him while you were in the hospital.  He came cheap.
Yes?
Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
My mind's lovely.  And yours?
Go.
A visitor.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
Sure.
But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.
It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
What rumors might those be?
A homosexual scandal, you mean? For me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks.
Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
He's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  As important as the Mona Lisa.
Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...
No, but you dress like an asshole ...
Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...
One more night --
You got no choice. It's over.
Kip.
Consider me gone, Detective --
Double-meaning intended --
Double-meaning intended, right?
It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
Good.
That's an after-market alarm. Can't just cut her wires ...
Hey, Donny --
Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics expert. He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ...
Gray.
Jonathan Quayle Higgins ...
You know where the others are?
That's a good one, Donny...
Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...
No ... And they won't take my calls ...
We don't -- ?
I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
What time of year?
We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
You've been pre-booked...
Yeah... You want a ride...
Damn crooks is everywhere --
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
Yeah --
Hey, now -
Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...
The family that steals together, deals together...
I'm cool.
I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
I know ...
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
Sure, man --
What for -- ?
Yeah. He's knows of one all right.
For real?
Nope. I got a coffee. And a boyfriend.
On account of me.
Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
What's wrong with her -- ?
No. Open her ...
No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
Shhh... Car thieves are your weakness.
I take out my slim-jim...
Woo-woo-wooooo!
And Tracy's on the move ...
Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
"A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield?
His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
In order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket. And...
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
Busting his balls?  If I was busting your balls, I'd send you home for your shine box.
Wha?  Me?
Nods again.
Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.
Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.
Shit.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
I don't want to hear about her anymore.
She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
Fuck Jimmy and the money. Didn't I tell you I gotta get out of here first.  I gotta straighten every- thing out with Paulie or I'm dead.
Just get me out.
You what?
Yeah. What about the kids' school?
Jimmy. He'll be okay. He's good for it. Relax.
What?
It's been six months.
Jimmy.
Nah.
Yeah.
Done.
My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me.
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.
No, no. It's okay.
No. It's okay. Just watch this. Watch it.
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
He's with his friends.
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
That's important.
But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie.  You know me all my life.  I've always done the right thing.
What are we gonna do up there?
We're not goin'.  I don't even like "Kelly's."
Jesus Christ. Not even close.
No, and we got four of 'em.
I don't know yet.
Yeah, you're all invited over to Morgan's house for a complementary fish sandwhich.
No one. I didn't have the number.
What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
Yeah, I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you every day...
Ah, history I think.
How you doin'?
She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
And all the time he's apologizin' to the cat, goin' "I'm sorry." BANG, "I'm sorry." BANG!
Yah, all right...
NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!! IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!
Shut up.
Yah, that was different. Management was restructurin'--
The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.
You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in.
--These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated.
Retainer...
Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.
There's no problem. I was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies. My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian pre- capitalist and...
What're those?
--Half-red, half-black--
C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
So am I.  Yes. That's right, Will. Most days I wish I never met you. Because then I could sleep at night. I wouldn't have to walk around with the knowledge that someone like you was out there. And I wouldn't have to watch you throw it all away.
It's Saturday.
Uh-oh.
Well, it seems we're in the presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau is a Field's Medal winner. Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.
I got your card.
He was alive over a hundred years ago. He was Indian. Dots, not feathers...
Five.
Not at all.
I been here a couple years.
We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
Who?
--Gerry--
--And why does he hang out with his friends? Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. It's called loyalty!
--And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!
He's not you!
You should come. I'll buy you a drink.
I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
He was my roommate in college.
I don't got a crush on her.
--you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for "Mike" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book.
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your shot. Take some pride in it. You go to church? So fuckin' what, God loves you. I mean, Christ. A guy as well known as you? By the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house Sunday nights you probably look like "Inspector Cluseau."
How about the ones on that shelf?
I did.
How about Noam Chomsky's "Manufacturing Consent?"
You think so?
You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
285.
This is a real piece of shit.
Maybe you married the wrong woman.
Time's up.
You've never been on a plane.
Hence, the word remarried.
No, I don't.
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
What did I think?
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
You're not going to fail me are you?
--No, have you had any experience with that?
I used to go with the wrench.
It's not your fault.
Yeah, I think so.
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
What?
I kind of got that impression.
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
Not a chance.
Bullshit.
I'm supposed to understand this.
No.
All right, all right. We'll go.
It's important that I learn this.
I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
How do you know that?
'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.
What am I scared of?
Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?
No, you don't want to hear that.
I love you, Will.  No take-backs.
Goodbye.
You trying to tell me how to run my own business?
Joe!
Reckon we better begin roustin' 'em out if we aim to get outa here by daylight. How about it, John? How you boys comin'? 
Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
Well, you ain't a-goin'! Ain't *nobody* else a-goin'! We *got* here an' we gonna *stay* here, together! As long as we got the fambly unbroke I ain't scared, but it's a long bitter road we got ahead of us--  --an' I'm here to tell ya ef anybody else tries to bust us up anymore I'm a-goin' cat wild with this here piece a bar-arn!
Watch me pass that Chevvy.
Don't hold me so tight.
Well, we ain't out a it yet.
Fan-belt's shot.
She got to make it.
What'd he look like again?
Hey, wait a minute. You got change comin'.
Joad.
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
Say, who runs this place?
Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.
Crate fell on me.
Goodnight.
Shore it is. It always is, this time a year.
What you figger to do?
Thought you was in jail.
Try an' tell 'em, Tom. They'll get two an' a half, jus' the minute we're gone. An' you know what that is? That's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar. That way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom! Them peaches is *ripe*. Two days out an' they'll pay *all* of us five!
No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work.
Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
Can't you see that sticker?
You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been?
You been acrost?
Five they're a-gettin' now, an' that's all they're int'rested in. I know exackly what Pa'd say. He'd jus' say it wasn't none a his business.
Hush!
No longer'n we can get acrost her.
I'll walk back.
You git. Go on now, git. You ain't doin' no good. They ain't enough for you.
Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it.
This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains.
Go get Tom an' Al.  I dunno what to do. I got to feed the fambly. What'm I gonna do with these here?
We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy.  Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?
Sometimes they do.
I'm ready.
That's right. And douse some in it.
Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
Comes night we'll get outa here.
I'd hate to get *trapped* in here.
Don't know--but it's better'n this.
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
He was a good man.
Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.
How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?
I know, ma'am... on'y it's for a ole lady, no teeth, gotta sof'n it with water so she can chew it, an' she's hongry.
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now.  The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.
Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.
Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self.  Reckon we could git him *drunk*?
I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
If this don't beat all!  Well, I see you been busy already!
I wisht it was day.
Now don't you go monk'ing--
In the corporate offices.
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
Don't say that.
Wonderful.
You could've been a contender, huh?
He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
Overflowing with love.
You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
Correct.  That's for you. Keep it.
Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
Okay.
Unbelievable.
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
I think they'll probably have booze there.
We haven't seen each other since high school.
Like heroin?
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
What stuff?
Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm on my way to the reunion.
I work alone.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
Up on the right.
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
Hard to get good help these days.
I didn't get into this business to have "associates." And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. "Loner-- " "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my own." That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends!
Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.
I guess.
I don't think so.
No...
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
That's going to cost.
And they want me to make up for it.
I've looked at it.
Yeah. I guess we did.
Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called.
You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
All by yourself?
Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?
It is cocktail hour yet?
Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.
Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.
College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
Why?
I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!
Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.
I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
I brought it to you in the hospital.
I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me?
I didn't know I had to.
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
Then why do you want to leave?
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
Did you go riding?
Yeah, you know everything!!
LEAVE ME ALONE!!
I said... I started.
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
That's not true.
Hi.
They're still our friends, Annie. It's nothing serious. You kid about them all the time... And I could tell Paul really appreciated me being there.
No.
Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
I know. We miss you too.
Night.
You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.
Let's not talk about that now.
Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
What do you mean?
Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...
Yes, it does.
Promise?
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be. Tom?
What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.
Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
Our daddy raised Pure Herefords.
And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves...
He thought it was a ghost.
Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.
You know, you're a good kid.
I don't know if I can with my leg.
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
Getting old. Not being of much use, I guess.  What went on out there, Grace? With Pilgrim?
Can I come? I'll start a fire...
I just could never say it!
No, not yet.
YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
You just showing off for her!
How long were you married?
Sometimes.
Where did you learn all this stuff?
About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
Hack the Planet!
Waste the dude.
The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or something.
Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
Difficulty rating?
Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!
No. No one special.
And unpack.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
That's bullshit.
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
This is the end, my friend.  Thank you for calling!
Joey's getting stupid busy.
We did it!
Pool on the roof must have a leak.
You're the moron that's been invading my turf?
It's cool, I'm just looking.
Yeah?
Okay. I'll copy it.
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
I'll hack the Gibson.
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I've got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari Kari...
Sorry, I can't help you, okay?
I think we've got something.
Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?  A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
We caught 'em.
Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.
What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again!
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
Run anti-virus. Give me a systems display!
Joey, Joey...
You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
Someone didn't bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords. Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the for most used passwords are love,  sex, secret and...  ...God. So would your holiness care to change her password?
Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The secret service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it.
Sh, sh sh sh sh.
Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
Nonono, thank YOU!
Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
Thank you.
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
Real charmer.
All right.
We've been better.
What does that mean?
Brady! Come with us.
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.
Its too late.
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
About what?
How many bodies did you find?
I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.
No way. No how.
Got it Earl.
Like a sister?
Like a real sister?
You bet.
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
All right.
You knew. You just didn't care.
Hi Jamie.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
Right here, Ben.
Yeah in the trunk of my squad.
Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
Least I'm not alone.
Dear God.
Be here in a minute.
Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
They've survived this ordeal, they'll survive it's memory.
Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?
Huh?
He shouts, too.
We just talked.
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.
He can still watch.
Annie!
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
Come with me.
Okay. First I rip your clothes off...
Promise?
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
See you.
There is no such thing.
There was no one outside.
We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
Tommy, let me in!
He'll barely be able to sit up.
The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
Mmm?
I can't believe it!
Well, let's hope so.
Well, let's do it.
Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
No, he called late last night.
I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.
Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny.  But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm.
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
Really?  Is the food that bad?
What time do you get off?
Yes.
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
Oh, okay.
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
When did you first notice this?
The hospital?  What kind of tests?
Uh-huh.
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. 
How's Frederick?  He didn't come.
...ex-husband on the street the other day.
Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol.
Well, i-if-if you have some free time...
Yes?
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
Oh.
Yeah.
Yes, it made me cry  it was so beautiful...so romantic.
Why, you know the situation.
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
But not over me?
I didn't sleep all night.
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
No.
It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else.
Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
Holly and April, thanks for helping.
I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
Was I?
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
Leave me alone, can you?!
You're not lost.
Get his wine away.
I am glad to see you.
We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...
Oh, honey!
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
No, nothing.
Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with. 
Because he likes you.
Yeah.
You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz.  More gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions.
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
I'm saying it now!
Yeah.
Oh...
But not you.
I can't keep my mind on the show.
Yeah...but you're not dying!
I went into a store, I bought a rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself.  The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath.
Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you?  That makes everything...
Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.
You are, Holly.  Stop it.
Oh, now-- 
Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
Yeah.
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
...you know?  I, uh...
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
No, no, we decided!
Two thousand dollars.
Uh-oh.
She really does, though.
I should get a garter belt.
It's, uh, you never know--
Oh!
Well, how about this?
Oh, yeah. 
Well, I think he was dying to open up.  It's so sad.  Now...what should I wear to my audition?
No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it. 
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
But what I decided to do is some writing.  Yeah, I think I've had it with acting.  You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls.  And I can't handle another rejection.  Now let's face it here.  I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life.  You know--something with a future.  I'm not sixteen anymore.  It's just...crazy!  I've got...an idea for a story. More than one.  And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even.
How?
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
You want some?
Yeah.  Me, too.
...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials.
I'm fine.
Yeah?
...in a really horrible way.
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
Yeah.
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
You've always hated my taste in the past.
I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
Hmm.
It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed.
I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
Oh, who cares?
Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.
I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault.  I-- 
Just a few minutes ago.
God.
Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
Oh...
Hmm.
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
...I was <u>working</u>...
I <u>swear</u> to you...
I have not read you your rights.
Or, perhaps...
Then who's buying it?
Let's keep it to business, shall we?
...they did it for a lark.
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
And have <u>you</u> found Peace..? 
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
Then I'm doing fine.
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
They got that kind of money?
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
Show me the Pigs.
Good evening, Dr. Lechter.  Thank you for coming.  I am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances.
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
I've never heard that he...
I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
Do you know the <u>seller</u>?
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a <u>spinal</u>, tomorrow, you wuunt feel <u>anything</u> down there, a l'il <u>pulling</u> is all.  N'I'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.  What do you say...?  I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it <u>around</u>...  ...stay with me now, <u>fuss</u> with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a <u>code</u>... move that money to me, he <u>confirms</u> it, and I fix you up Right Now...  Whatsay?
Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a <u>hobbyist</u>...
We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
He requests your presence, once again, as part of...
You nervous...?
How's your <u>child</u>?
...should love to correct your error. 
And how good of <u>you</u> to remember it. Then, this trip, then, is not a return to <u>America</u>...
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
I'll have them picked up.
You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?
How so?
I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
Enchante.
Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do I owe...?
Yes, of course, and we'll <u>collect</u> them. I won't be a minute...
Where do you live?
I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of took her down in a snap of the <u>fingers</u>-- <u>But</u>-- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement...
Let's get her <u>out</u> of here....
What is that that smells so wonderful.
And how did he do that?
...but will that satisfy you?
<u>Yes</u>.
Well.  <u>Excellent</u>... I'm...
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
Yeah, but who would marry friendless <u>me</u>...  Howabout you, Romeo...?
The Multi-Jurisdiction Task Force:  read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda Drumgo.  The man's hazing you.
I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
We are here on sufferance.  I am here...

No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
...no...
...would you use a small word?
What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
...yes...?
When?
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...
Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.

Not now, Wendy.
No. Fuck no. If you met yourself as a child, would you hug her and say everything's going to be okay...
What are you doing, Wendy?  What's in that cup?
Shoot.
You're beautiful.
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
Because you're an idiot.
Something like that. Will you do it?
Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.
I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
Geez, don't listen to them.
Never say never.
Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.
Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
Color me nauseous.
I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her first Remington Party. Blow it tonight girl and it's keggers with kids all next year.
Very very. The photographs?
Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
Give me the clipboard.
Uh-huh.
I don't really like your friends either.
Maybe it's time for a vacation.
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
Chick-en.
This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
French.
Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
"You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's call the whole thing off...Hold it!
Wait a....You're not listening! I'm not on your side....
You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting?
No-o!
Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?
What?
Shit, we're seniors, Ram. Too old for that crap. Let's give him a scare though.
Goddamn Geek!
Shut the fuck up, all right.
Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight.
This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life.
Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness.
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
Sure. Ciao.
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
Look who I've found!
pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline.
Is it hurting, dear?
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
I'm not hungry.
But she'll have no one to look after her!
Well, I guess I take after you then!
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?

I don't wanna be in bloody school!
Love, you can still write to each other.
looks down at the ground in front of her.
and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.
Thank you so much!
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper.
I put on a lot of weight over Christmas.
Somebody's got to help us!
He . . .
That . . .
That idiot boarder?
No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!
You mean travel by ourselves?
I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage!
Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other.
Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
Your insight is enlightening.
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
Some call it resilience. Others, stupidity.
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
Well?
Did I ever talk about the accident?
What was it?
Just get better okay?
Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
Really? Do tell.
Ambrose. I know.
I saw her drowning inside the car, detective.
What's that?
Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
I'm... I'm doing a very special thing here. And you can't even ... respond?
This isn't happening.
Yes. Now go back to sleep. You're driving the rest of the way to gramma's remember?
What?
How much do I stand to inherit if Kirsty is presumed dead?
All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?
Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you, forget. You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.
No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight-
Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
YOU!
For starters. It's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew.
What am I, a goddamn postman?  I'm way the fuck up here, I'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter?  Put a stamp on it for Chrissake!
I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
I got your bail continued.
I took a loan on my car and my computer.
Mister LaPlante...
Mister LaPlante...
You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?
The same thing that always happens! You blew it! And this time you broke your son's heart instead of mine!  He was so proud, looking forward to going to a movie with his father... and you let him down!  Like you let everybody down, always!  What did you do, take a mudbath?
I had to explain your tendancy to "exaggerate", How you were actually "in country" all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your outfit, no more, no less...
Use the phone, Bernie, call him tomorrow, he'd like to hear from you.  Where's your other shoe? Never mind!  I don't want to know. Some fantastic adventure, right? Something really crazy.
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
What's your scheme, Mister LaPlante? What are you forcing John Bubber to do?  What are you -- ?
Thanks.  Thanks, pal.
You were saying you don't want a million dollars.
John, I'm sure she could support just about anything.  I think I'll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard.  Make sure no harm comes to you.
It's been sometime since, uh, I received any, uh, of that kind of, uh... attention.  A couple of... years.
Gale... you're a very nice person. I wouldn't want to hurt you... in any way...
You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....
A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'
Gale...
I told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy...
She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
Said he's not an actor.
Quit?  She wants to quit?
For ten more minutes they love him, Wally.  I'm sick of him and I'm always about ten minutes ahead of the public.
Dad!
Never reach out!
An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
How are they with kids?
So this really does the trick, eh?
Okay.
Whoa, check it out.
-- institution.
Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like.
You're responsible for your own actions and you don't mean to hurt anyone.  In other words, you've done <u>your</u> best.  I'm saying don't carry the burden of <u>other</u> people's actions on your shoulders, because they're beyond your control.
Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
I understand that.
It's not going to happen unless you make it happen, my friend. You're going to have to assert yourself a little bit more.  <u>Show</u> your affection.
There's so much I want to say to her, it's all jumbled up in my mind, and I don't want her to misunderstand --
Sure.
Maybe I could take a look at it now.
It's a living.
I was alone a lot as a child.  No one to compete with.  My parents ensured that I found happiness in the smallest things.  When you're all alone it's your own world, you don't have to take orders from anybody.  You don't necessarily believe the stories people tell you.
Because you <u>were</u> pretty?
Uh huh.
'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf...'
I'm thirsty.
A man scared me.
The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
I don't <u>know</u> how it started!
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
What's that?
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
What?
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
All new houses have noises.
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
Where should I hide the car keys?
Yeah -- she did a good job.  This glass looks brand-new.
I'm <u>fired</u>.  I'm unemployed.  Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength?  Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off!
Someone blew the whistle.  Someone hates me.
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house.
We'll talk in the morning.
Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.
Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
Two -- three if you count the husband.
Grow up, Dreyer.
The thermometer's broken.
-- A man.
Even cosier.
Thank you -- how efficient of you.
Promise.
Really.
No joke, Lieutenant.
Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
Not now.  I'm busy.
Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.
Yes.
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
It's circumstantial.
Is that it?
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were.
Maybe he was a lousy shot.
It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
I hear you.
That's all?
That is what bothers me.
Then it's worth the journey.
How long is the voyage?
I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
That doesn't matter.
I think you just like to eat dirt.
Where do you go when your mind drifts?
Why not?
Aye.
I remember you.
I don't think we have anything to talk about, Miss Hillman.
You got me.
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
It's mine.  It's been in my family for years.  It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.
You remind me of someone I used to know.
Then how did he know your name?
I've lived all over the world.
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
You?
Get out.
How could they get by him?
And this?
That's what the Kurgan said.
It will not end tonight.
No.
Me too.
I love you, Conner.
You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.
I can take care of myself.
That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
It's happening right now.
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers and judges who can help you.
You won't die if you let me help.
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
You're being stupid.  Check out the bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a window --
I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.
I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.
We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead.  They think you murdered him.
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
You can't run with suitcases.
They'll cut the power.
I don't know.
Okey-doke.
You said they would be here!
I know.
I don't drink beer.
We're hungry.  You're going to cook.
He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.
Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
What are you doing?!  Stop that!
Just one question.  Please.
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
York Estates.  Four-five-five Castle Way. Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
Go, Chief.
Go, Chief.
I know the one.
You have her cell number?
They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.
Order your men to stand down.
You've been here all day, Chief.  Take a break.  See your family.  If I need you, I'll call.
Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
Yes, sir.
Are all of you named Jones?
What?
Where's the office?
Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up.  You gotta help him.
If I try to climb out they'll see me on the security cameras.  They would see you outside, too --
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
How do I reach him?
Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
What do you want?
You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.
You want . . . Marlon and Al.
These disks . . . where are they?
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
I'll be back.
How many in your family?
Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
Yes we have.
Where is she?
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
What did they say?
The high command? Our high command?
We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
Today.
No.
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
Listen, you need me.
How so.
You think they will believe you?
You have no whiskey?
Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.
Great.  No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.
Fuck you.
Thank God.
For supplies, you drive.
Just drive, Gregoire.
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
I would never do that.
Call, sir?
He will be here.
What?
They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
I need a great favor.
I will see what I can do.
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
Of course.
Please, be quiet.
I couldn't help.
What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
No, Odette says he's in shock.
Please go back, bring the children to us.
But who is left?
So where is the lamb?
A kiss.
Yes.
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
What sort of car?
A Volkswagen!
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
Many times.
Boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know I'm Tutsi.
How dead?
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
Many beers.
Yes, thank you Mr. President.
Paul, do everything you can to buy time. I will call you back.
Where?
What is his room number?
I'm confused.
Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
It was on my Dad's list of "things to do." But the House did him first.
Three times, to be exact.
I think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation!
As a tumor.
Yeah, me too.
The...Fourth of July.
What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
Yeah. But, hey, anybody who's not "comfortable" with the rules, you're free to walk, anytime. Seven digits poorer, goes without saying.
Best of a nightmare.
Prove it.
Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?
I'm better than that.
Most fun I've had all day.
Not in the movie biz. So, c'mon, gimme the truth.
An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.
Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
Better living through electricity.
He's gotta still be down here.
It's succeeding!
Jesus!
Cheer up: before the night's through, I'm sure one of us'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something.
I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
Oh, I think we're going to have several.
Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.
Question answered.
No. OhmyGod, Pritchett was right -- The house <u><b>IS</b></u> haunted.
You didn't think to ask?
What?
I wouldn't be opening this place tomorrow if every single thing down to the beheaded Beanie Babies hadn't tested 100% safe.
Maybe if I --
Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing.
What?
Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum.
I think I'll do what I damn well please.
I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon.
Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
The lockdown thing.
What's going on?
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
I thought you understood.... It's the souls of Vannacutt's dead... The insanity... The horror... Victims burned alive... All that pain percolating somewhere in the house for seventy-some years...  ...singing this will be the day that I die... This will be the day that I....
-- ten.
Over here.
I did a cross search, death certificates with this address. James and Marion Foster.  They had a daughter.  Right here, it says James died, 1882, pneumonia. Marion dies September the next year. Suicide.
The style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era Marion Foster killed herself.  Who else could have gone in there and done something like that?
A few years older, perhaps.
I'm sorry.
It's origin is unknown.  The symbol does correspond  to a dagger I acquired many years ago.
By killing them?
Maybe it was Colleen...
No it won't - no it won't!
I'm scared!
I'm ok mommy.
Sure.  Did you see the others?
He's blessing the house.
It's dark!  I can't breathe!
Fight it back Aubrey.  Fight it back as hard as you can!
Good night daddy.
Aubrey run! Aubrey stares in horror at Maura - just then the knife FADES AWAY as Maura rolls over, returned to normal -
Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
Whatever you say.
To our family.
Or what she was worth.
I don't think she willed it to me out of sentiment.  She didn't even know who I was.  It's just... tradition.
So what are you saying?
You seem to appreciate the local scenery.
Should I...
What's happening!
We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
How can I help you?
Good night.
What are you getting at!
It will not take long...
It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...
Runic?
Jesus Christ ...
Correct.  The fields of France.  And many dead flowers ... Oh.  Forgive me. My name was Spenser.  Elliott Spenser. Captain.
And why are you back?  Why are we here?
So where is it?
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
What is it?
I'm trying to quit.
It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
I don't think so.  But it's a fascinating subject.  Did you ...
Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
Buying some drugs, alright?
God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
I don't know.  Maybe.
On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
Hey, that's what makes the world go round.
Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
Hudson, God's given you a gift for cat burglary, you can t just...
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
Oh man, you still got a thing for those unmasculine European coffees? Who's your buddy?
Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.
Just means it'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce.  You re still the best, I know it.
Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting out a fire with kerosene.
Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.
What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.
You sound disappointed.
Ooh-kay...
Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
Snickers, baby, I love you like a brother, but really, who cares? Silencer bomb...
That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said "Polite conversation is rarely either."
A little petting is not the issue!
God go with you, sister.
Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...
That's what you theenk.
Never, why do you ask?
Sure Hudson.  Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?
Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.
Wow, you were "in the joint." "Doing hard time."  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners.
Uh....old badminton injury.
Ooh, I guess I do know something Here's looking at you, kid...
You re not "some guy" anymore, Hudson.  Right now, you're the only guy.  Without your help, I....
Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.
This is too bad to be false.
Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.
Actually he never told us what it was.
Or you cut off my thingie. Directions even your brother would understand.
I don't care.
You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...
You want an address on that last one?
But you're going to tell us anyway...
Uh, yeah.  Cut to the chase.
For God's sake, chain this convict.
It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
You can't, convict!  You're just a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them.  It rains, car crash stops traffic, you say "How could this happen to me?"  It's a natural inclination.  But for I, this isn't a fantasy, it is <u>reality</u>! You are on my planet!  You walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist!  The lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!
Employer?  The president?
Yeah, right.  By the way, as long as I'm getting things off my chest, I'm the one who killed your little monkey.  Made it look like a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun. Ciao.
I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
I'm happy enough.
Them po' young folks. Looks like Norville's in fo' the same kind o' heartache ol' Warin' had. But then, she never axed me 'bout dat...
Adenoids?
Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron --
-- or lack thereof?
Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
...I'm sorry.
No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
Now, Aim --
Worked in a watch factory?
Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --
Phony, huh?
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
What the heck they doin'?
...Geez.
It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
But, buddy --
We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room!
Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
And Sid says you stole it!
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
Well, why don't ya read it.
Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.
You have a charming wife, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid.
You --
Sure, sure. And did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or...  ...'schmoe'?
Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
Get out of my sight.
Damnit, where's my car!
Well... I'm for it...
She sits down.
Plan two: Here come the waterworks.
...Her mother needs an operation...
No, Bennie: Lumbago.
Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland.  The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.
Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.
It'll wait.
Did you hear what he sang?
That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
One of these days he'll start on you, the way he did on her.  "You think life's beautiful, don't you, Jessica?  You think you're beautiful, don't you, Jessica?"  What he could do to that word "beautiful." That's Paul's great weapon -- words.  He uses them the way other men use their fists.
Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
You can't really believe that.
I'm not sure I can make you understand.  You know what this is?
Yes.  But it was once the figurehead of a slave ship.  That's where our people came from -- from the misery and pain of slavery. For generations they found life a burden. That's why they still weep when a child is born -- and make merry at a burial.
Of course not!
Don't.  It will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great  unhappiness.
Still, I feel you should remove the decanter.  Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is.
You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life.  There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity.  Why did you do it?
I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever.
But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
Paul, we're not trying to blame Miss Connell.  It isn't a question of blame.  It's a question of what we are to do with Jessica.  The commissioner is very concerned.
In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
Foolish?  Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!
Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.
You're wrong, Wesley.  The guilt is mine -- all of it.
That night, I went to the Houmfort. I kept seeing Jessica's face -- smiling -- smiling because two men hated each other -- because she was beautiful enough to take my family in her hands and break it apart. The drums seemed to be beating in my head.  The chanting -- the lights --  everything blurred together.  And then I heard a voice, speaking in a sudden silence.  My voice.  I was possessed.  I said that the woman at Fort Holland was evil and that the Houngan must maker her a Zombie.
Up the organization!  Bastard.
Why shouldn't she be?
I do. I'm -- are you...?
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
That one.
In the car.
Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.
Elena.
Ben.
The phone's out.
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
Yeah.
Well, the whole gamut. Facts of life and all. Some fatherly advice, because, I tell you, there's things happening that you're probably old enough... well...  For example, on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case -- and, um, not onto the linen, and not on your sister's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother --
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
I just can't believe you could be so --
Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.
I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home.
Huh?
C'mon.
But what?
Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all.
Nah, that wasn't in the contract.
Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
Yeah. You?
Sure. Maybe coffee.
We were just riding around.
Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.
It's really quite all right.
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
It's not like we're too busy.
You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me.
Forget how to ride a bike.
That's right.
But not too ashamed.
I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care.
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
And remember, with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb, do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex -- because you drone on like a motherfucker when you're stoned.
Aha! I could sense the vibe.
My man, I speak to you solely as a comrade in arms offering unconditional aid. I've been giving this one a lot of thought, and I believe that the two of you together might just reach that higher ground that --
Major.
Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
Thanks for the advice dad.
Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.
Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
I dunno. I --
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
Can I come?
What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
Hey Sandy.
Huh?
Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.
What's the D.A. got them on?
Detective Eckhart!  I know!  Welcome to Nightmute!
Don't worry about him...
The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in extra innings.  The Hawks have a really good line-up this year.
What I saw?
Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.
She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books.
Seven years.
Even the best make mistakes.
You know what about.
When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...  We have to figure out a plan of action now.
I'm always all business.
That's a long time.
That's what I said.
What was it?
Yes down at the station.
But she was an attractive girl.
Yes.
No back-up.
Drop the gun, Walter.
We had feared we were the only ones...
Ah! You have questions?
Surely you know the one who made you...
Then God does not exist...
That's what the one who made me said.
Like moths around the candle of the age. Decadent, useless. They can't reflect anything. But you do. You reflect its broken heart.
You let them do it.
What night? What do you mean?
It will grow back again!
I came to make peace with you, even if you're the father of lies. I want things to be as they were.
Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
Sit still. It's not finished -
And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up.
Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
The workmen must have a trunk - don't stop, cherie -
Not yet.
It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.
What danger?
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
You really believe that?
Yes...
But if she dies...
Give it to me!!!
Kill me if you will, but I can't do this...
You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
Yes...
It can't be...
Do you think so?
We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?
Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.
Respect me a little then. I'm the only life you know.
NO!!!
No...
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear. You left her alive.
CLAUDIA!!!
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
If you stayed with me Louis, I could venture out... little by little... become the old Lestat.
That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
Perhaps lucky for both of us.
Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris...
Au contraire, monsieur, I have.
Yes...
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
Checking in...Karla Wilson.
Is that bad?
And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
What about a radio?
What the hell would you call this?
Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.
Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
I will, and you remind me of the same thing.
Karla! You promised.
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
Yes.
Some.
Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
I'm right here. Grab my hand.
Why are you being like this?
What? The Bahamas? You're kidding.
Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay.  We got the refrigerator in. Come see.
I don't know.
To get out of Southport?
I'm okay.
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.
I'll talk real slow.
Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
Honey, some folks just can't fly.
Why?
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
How much?
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
What is up with that weirdo?
That staggering. His dying so quickly.  In your campaigns, have you never seen men who staggered before they died, who talked incoherently  walked blindly.
Or even spirit messages from the next world.
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
Let us put it to the test. Protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. I'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to Hermes -- not that I believe in him any more than I do in Science.
I just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you.
Sleep well.
I think she went to bed  I saw her going toward the house
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
I don't know now without my father.
She has never mentioned her family.
In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then - I'll not die  I'll watch - they shall not hurt you.
That should decide it or you --
Whet do you mean?
You were father's secretary - I never thought - -
Really, this is idiotic!
Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
Yes?
You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
Why -- no not before Thea came 
This girl -- Thea - is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.
Hero?
But that should make you like her.
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
We still don't know that it's the plague 
If she looked like Thea, she must have been beautiful.
Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
He hates all my race.
It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
It is for that he hates me.
How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?
All right  all right.
Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?
Bert! Thank heaven you're here!
I hate to do this, fella.
Yeah, very funny.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it.
No wonder you jumped in the river.
Sure I know where he lives. He lives in Bailey Park.
Oh, well, I can't . . .
Well, naturally. Of course.
Not a soul.
That's right. Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college. Harry became a football star  made second team All American.
Yes, but George . . .
You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
Hiya, George!
Looks like we'll have to send someone down  a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.
Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
When'd you see him last?
Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
Goodbye, Sam.
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
Oh  Welch. That's what I get for praying.
Came back three days ago.
Look, Nick. What's wrong?
What's that got to do with it? I don't know you from Adam's off ox.  Hey, you! Rummy! Come here! Come here!
I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
Maybe you were born older, George.
Have a good time, son.
Very funny. Very funny.
Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library.
Yeah  yeah . . . sure I will.
Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.
Hello?
You like it? I'll send you a box.
What is it  a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
Beautiful.
I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now watch . . . right on the second floor there.
What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . .
Thank you.
Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
That does it  come here.
Lassos the stork! You mean you . . . What is it, a boy or a girl?
What?
Oh, shucks . . .
But of course.
Someone pop your balloon?
Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.
Back down!
They're moving pretty fast.
That's awful.
Lucky.  Lucky, lucky, lucky.
Too hot in the lighthouse?
We'll take your supercargo.
You're betting what you already got.
Can you get us a line?
N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
Aren't you off-duty?
Happy to do it.
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
Never mind that shit.  Just point.
No place special.  Just hanging out.
Okay, not bartending.  Why on the water every day?
Okay, okay.
Oh, c'mon.
Yeah?
Did you get any pictures?
All of us thank you, okay?
Too late, it's written.
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
That's it.
So there's one around here.
Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
MMMmmmorning....
Mrs. Silvera.
Better yet.
Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one.
Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
For me?
Ooohh, nothing.  I just got fired, that's all.
What'd I say?
Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....
Turn in the car.  Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.
Just one minute....
It's still a good idea.
Go ahead, whatever it's worth.
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
No.  Find your brother, okay?
What's daddy doing?
Sure they did....
Tide doesn't turn for three hours.
Great.
Huh?
Next week.
Nope.
Just like this.
The tide's running.  It'll take us to the light.
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
Anything?
Until we find something.
I'm not sure I can.
I can go out if I want to.
Name it.
We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide.
If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
Sean, baby, please....
Coming about, then.
Quiet!  Shhh!
Okay, okay.  Close your door.
I'm not in the way.  Andy, am I in the way?
So?  So?
I have to walk him till the drug wears off.
I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.
No, I'm fine, thanks.
No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
With those camera lights and...
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
Yeah.  Down there.
How many sharks have you killed?
Want another one?
See you later.
Get out of here!
They just wanted to say hello.
Let's not talk about that now, okay?
That we swim.
Make up your mind.
It's never over...  Here comes another six years of bad dreams.
No.
I can't take water, Kathryn.
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
... Okay.
But you --
On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.
It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
Because I don't trust you, that's why.
Afraid I can't do that.
Should be coming out of it soon.
Is there such a place?  A cave or something with such a flow?
The water ski show!  We have to get them out!
The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
And big for his age.
Someone's looking for you.
Come on!  Check this out!
It's okay, Sean.
Hold still, damn it!
Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!
Now what?
Don't you dare.
Hey.
Calvin said it was all right.
Aww, can't I keep it?
Kind of dull in there for you, isn't it?  Why don't you throw in another shark?
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
... I'll go to McDonalds.
So was Dad.
He needs a haircut.
Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
Something wrong?
We're in love.
Absolutely.  The audience will stain their drawers.  I did.
Watch me, Grandma....
But you always let me....
It sure is....
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
No....
She could have been killed...You knew and you didn't tell us...You let your mother think....
How could you do that?  Your own daughter....
I'm sorry.  Please, Carla.  I didn't think there was any danger.  I'm sorry. I love you.  Both of you.
I'm not on vacation....
I like it.  Really....
Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
I'd be afraid of losing....
Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
It's beginning....
Whatever happens next.....
I don't know what he thinks...I don't know what I think...I don't even know why I'm talking about it...  It's silly...I'm getting too old for this sort of thing....
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
Hello?  Thea who?  I know it's Thea Brody.  How many grandchildren do I have?  I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl.  I know you're five.
He heard that.
What's going on?
It's not nice to be evasive.
The water's coming in...The water's coming in....
Good night, Daddy....
I'll miss you....
It's Jake's actually...Our floating lab....
I'm fine....
I'm not going to quit now....
You just got here....
I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark.  Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up.
No.
I'm going to finish what Jake and I started.  I owe him that.  Hell, I owe him everything....  I'll get something important done for both of us....
It could have been an accident....
I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
If you don't take it, we'll be swimming in a minute.
It's wonderful....
No!
What?
Why?
I have coffee in the thermos.
Just like that?
Yes I can....
A shark attacked Thea and some kids...She's going after it....
You sure you know how to do this.
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
Get her started....
Nothing!  What the hell are you doing down there?
Tell Thea I'm sorry....
Oh, boy....
Will you leave me alone...?
If we had some decent money, I'd be able to read their temperatures... Study their motor systems....
I made them, man....
You didn't stick them on right....
Where the hell's the beer...?
I didn't do it on purpose....
May your sex life be as busy as your shirt....
Don't say anything about this to my mother....
As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
What do you know about him?
I hear he flies a lot of private charters....
Nothing.. But stay within a quarter mile...I've got a three-mile radius on the monitor.  If he comes back I'll hear him.  You'll have time to get up.
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
Maybe he only likes white meat....
You don't like my voice...?
Mom....
My equipment doesn't crap out....
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
We're out of decaf...We're out of petty cash...And we're out of requisition forms....
Anything to do before I go home?
Yes.
What?
Oh no--
Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
"Welcome to Eureka."
Watch my lips, coz you're not gonna believe this - <u>this</u> is a rare occurrence. We haven't had a body in eighteen months.
I think you're here all day.
So am I. But where's my money?
Pay me, and I shut up.
I was wrong.
What does it matter what I bel- ieve? .. What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes ..
No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.
I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
No .. You didn't know that ..
Screw Citrine. He can fire me.
This "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas.
We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?
I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is <u>right</u> <u>now</u>, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..
Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..
Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
Wrong cabinet.
<u>If</u>, your friend from San Diego was up here, and thought for <u>one</u> out of <u>two fucken seconds</u>, she was a danger to him, he'da taken her out weeks ago ..
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
Do you pray?
Have you known her long?
I know.
No I'm not.
I'm blind because my father drank.
No, Sergeant, I got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who. And I might add, that in another six weeks, a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here, & driving away for their Christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name I-won't-know-either ..
Two or three years ago.
Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession.
Sure you can. Anyway, parties are all about standing still ..
I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.
No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.
No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to <u>stop</u> this bullshit. I don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing <u>me</u>, & <u>everyone</u> off.
A derelict.
Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
Ask him.
Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
I know about the bachelor party.
Jerry!  Do something --
-- stop --
There is something missing here.
You're imagining it.
No no. I knew.
I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery --
I just got goosebumps.
Well, I'm happy for you.
Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
Hi.
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
Happy. He said "happy?"
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
Fine, I just --
Why do you love me?
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
So this break... is a break-up.
Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello. _ 130.
Of course, medical! _ 42.
-- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  Playing in the state where you grew up.
I'll give it everything.
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
We signed an hour ago.  You were in the lobby with the black fella.
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.
You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
Why not?
Oh my God.
Forget it.  Forget it.
Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego.
No, I don't know.
No.  A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
No.
I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
No, you're --
Airight.  Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player.  You play with your head.  Not your heart.  In your personal life?  Heart. But when you get on the field --  _ 113.
I missed ya.  What can I say?
Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!
I know you say to take the Arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition.  _ 25.
Not a chance.
And say what?  "Please remove your dick from my ass?!"
The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
Came here to fire you, Jerry.
-- and I'll get 'em.
I've got the clients.  I've got the juice.
Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right.  _ 76.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.
Funny.
Shut up!!!
We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
Eric...
I filmed this the morning they left.
Eric!
I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, its was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
When did you have it last?
Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh?
I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
How low?
Here!
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
Just hold on.
We'll be broke in four weeks.
I don't think so.
KEEP GOING!
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?
Really?  What do you do there?
Let me know if I can help, Alan. Youre bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
A well-accepted theory.
In Costa Rica?
You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start.
But then you never get to go in space.
There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The "plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like that.
A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins.  If it escapes.  But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death.  Maybe I just feel too close to it my--
You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
It doesn't matter what I think.
After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.
Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
Operations building.  Far end of the street.
Why?
Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.
There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
You're going too?
Oh, my God.
Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
What's that?
It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
But why?
That's a scientific impossibility, you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study, you also change.
It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.
Where's Ian?
I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
'Bout thirty seconds.
Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?
These are dilated.  Take a look.
We're - - still perfecting a viewing system.  The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting.
John....
Why?
If they died together, they lived together. Suggests some kind of social order.
That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
They smell.
They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
The Cretaceous.
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
Dilophosaurus.
I'll just finish.  Yeah, I want to finish.
The other car!
Alan!
What's that?
Stick to my heels.
- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
Yeah.
- - shut up.
I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
In a box under my seat.
Yeah.
And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
Hey!  Where are the brakes?
Tim, I'll come back for you.  I'll get Lex out first.
This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
Not without massive sequence gaps!
You have no idea.
Occasionally.  Always on the lookout for the future ex- Mrs. Malcolm.
I know.
There's gotta be something - -
I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
No, I'm sorry, that  wouldn't be possible.  We've just discovered a new skeleton, and - -
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!
Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
Oh, I hate the other kind.
I guess we'll just have to evolve too.
Please!
Timmy!  The power is coming down, quick!
John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.
There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!
I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
Thanks for the presents.
Excellent.
Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!
Why did you do this?
Ken, it's Bruce. Listen, we've got a nibble on the Pendleton financing.
Yeah?
What about that other guy?
Fuck you.
Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
It's all right.  Now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. Someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years...  We'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
I always throw that in. It makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant.
This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
Checking out a theory. Just keep talking to him.
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
And if he's not?
If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.
Let's split up. You take the left side, I'll take the right. We'll meet in front of the Cineplex.
You have been hearing the sordid side then.
Yes -- we do.
You could say we represent the <u>un</u>official view of a well-ordered society.
The formality of a trial would be too costly for them.  They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support.
-- Small.
I don't know what you could have read.
Another one?
What an extraordinary request!
Not necessarily.  A <u>wife</u> would.
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
-- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as you, so I didn't know him as well -- but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it.
In a small way.
Sorry, yes -- well -- thank you, sir.
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.
Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss.  It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure.
-- Listen to me --
Wednesday.  We left the office together.
No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?
You mean you've actually begun some?
Then why haven't I been --
It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.
"Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.  And I find you.  A body snatcher.
He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?
Orlac is an account?
Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
Jack!...  Jack!
What a climax to the film - The first white men to set foot on ...  "Skull Island"  Twentieth Century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!
We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!
Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
That's your monkey, Denham.
Forget it, Denham ... for Godssake
Yeah.
Coz of something I lost.
Please, if he sees you, he won't come!
It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
Please --
Don't belong?
From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.
Here please.
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?
I go on rounds.
What do you think?
No.
It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
Try some other ways. 
No, I said what did you think.
Mm.
Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.
Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?
Why?
Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.
With Trina.
How do you know how bad it was?
Trask wants to talk with you.
Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me. 
I am.
Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.
Well there's a couple --
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
It's not so bad.
Goodbye, Pete.
I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
Then how are you involved?
Examine this letter please.  We recovered that from the shredder -- the plant disposal and incinerator system. Grunemann apparently typed it Friday, before he left, decided not to send it, tossed it away. We've already contacted the New York Police; they think they know the girl in question.
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.
I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
Inspector we understand your position; ours is a little different. We have an investment in Tom Grunemann. The Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves.
Yes sir, we know he --
Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along. Here, locally. But New York, that's - well --
Oh, yes.  Won't you come in.
The prospect of losing my child.
Detroit.
I see you have people there. What are their names?
What about your mommy?
Lunch in a restaurant.
Playing.
In real life when does he hit you?
Greatest...
Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
I'll call Thelma and remind her, okay?  Don't worry.
I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--
That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
No.
I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
You're no bargain either, pal.
That's okay, pal.  Go back to sleep.  It's very late.
Uh huh?
You mean for good?
Sure.
I don't know.  I hadn't thought much about it.
Daddy, what if The Face comes when I'm at mommy's?
Overruled.  The witness will answer, please.
Sustained.
Yes, your honor.
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
Yes.  Very much.
Your honor, I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla, California.
Your honor, I'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at?  Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life?
No questions.
While the child was in the care of the witness, he cut his face badly and is now scarred.
Yes...
Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer. You have just rewritten matrimonial law.  You were both divorced, Mrs. Kramer.
Ted, I'm leaving you.
Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
So we've got problems.  Everybody's got problems--that's normal--
What?
Joanna, I don't give a--
Joanna, what the hell is--
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
You want to know the real kicker?  The real kicker is, for the first time in my life-- the first time--I feel like a loser.
I don't know, Jim.  This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.
I don't know, Jim...
Are you firing me, Jim?
Sure.
I can't.  I've got Billy to take care of.
I don't believe you.
But it's not a year from now, is it?
You've got that look.  My lady and I split two years ago in August and I'm an old pro at this shit.  First thing, stay away from the Children's Zoo.  It's pure hell--if I never see another chicken, I'll be happy.  I'm here, darling.  Don't worry...
I don't know, John...I mean, to be brutally honest, I'm not so sure what kind of mental shape Joanna's in right now.  Y'know she admitted she was seeing a shrink.
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
It's beautiful.  It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship.
No.
Look, Ted, all I--
Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to.  Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
I understand.
No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
No.  I don't think so.
A moment.
Yes. I am ready.
No cried?
It is alright, Father.
But, I am in charge.
Can I free the prisoners?
No!
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
And we will begin with tearing it down.
General Chiang.
Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
Far, far away.
He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die.
Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, "His time has come."
At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
I miss my brother.
How many?
Please.
I do not know, Holiness.
And, America?
The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said, "The Chinese soldiers -- they are coming." And then, the radio went dead.
Where is that?
And then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to Peking. Agreed. Send Ngabo. Is that all?
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
Good. Very good. Tibet is a great country. A wonderful history. Long ago, you even conquered part of China. But now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. In twenty years time you could be ahead of us. Then it will be your turn to help China.
Does he have the spot?
Is that a true story, or pretend?
True.
I have smarter men.
Is that true or pretend?
You cannot.
Ahh.
Ahh.
No, Holiness.
I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
I'll need any and all topographic studies.
Species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water. You've got a crocodile.  Bury your friend.
Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
I coulda shot you, you--
They don't really attack underwater and--
Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
You don't want to cut me down. 'Cause I'll kill you.
I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector.  Could you please cut me down?
I don't know!
Get the gun.
'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
That's actually the easy part.
U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
I'm a civilian!  You don't have any authority--
Oh, bullshit.
We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
Guess I finally got bit.
Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.
Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...
How would <u>you</u> know, what--
Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--
Good.
In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.
Good.  See ya soon.
Um... y'know...  Yeah.
But why <u>Maine</u> and why alone?  Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?
It's okay.
Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
Good idea.
Well...
You wouldn't?
Back us in a little, we need to get a shot!
No, I actually <u>want</u> to stay for a little while.
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
So does he.
You too.
I can look at dead things.
It's just that--
They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
You like Jack?
You think Jack's handsome?
I don't know.  It was like a tug. Something tugged us.
Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
A tooth?
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
<u>Kelly</u>--
I <u>tapped</u> you.
Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
It wasn't suppose to happen, I don't know what to say...
Hot damn, Clarice.
Sometimes.
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
Yes sir. I can find it by myself.
Starling -
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.
He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.
Well, she's not local. Her ears are pierced three times each, and she's wearing green glitter nail polish. Looks like town to me...
But if he knew we have so little time -
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
Witless and misleading. Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.
A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling.
What's that, Dr. Lecter?
Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
I never thought about it.
That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?
Was it a butterfly?
I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.
Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.
Why so briefly?
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?
First principles, Clarice. Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each particular thing, ask: What is it, in itself, what is its nature...? What does he do, this man you seek?
No! That's incidental.
Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
And - one morning I just - ran away...
Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...
You know I can't make that promise.
You want to see a violation? This is a violation...
That's a childish, bullying stunt, Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield surgeon, so you can put away your picture.
I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now?  Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
I have nothing to go back for.
Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
It can be dangerous...
I am sorry, Duncan...
We were headed...
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
That is sedition! Treason!
Do you hear me, sir!  If you ever fall... into British hands...  What white water?
Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.
You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
: Only one or two loads.
You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line. Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast and fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers...
No.  Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites.
What else?
...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
That's all, sir.
And what is that?
By your leave, sir.
Sir!!!  Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!
Fire!!!
Sir!
I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
"Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness."
Wampum?
Heart. Give Magua new heart.
But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
La victoire.
I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
Intelligence may not be the right word...
He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
What?...
Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
How do you know it was Williams?
You screw around like that again and--
Why can't we pick up his signal?
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
Where's Jones?
...I'd really have to show it to you.
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
And it killed Bo?
Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
Twelve hours, no big deal.  We should know something first thing in the morning.  Don't worry.
The weather's good, I already checked, but I'll be off in a minute.
Hook's on 24...
...and a Russian grandmother...
I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
No fuckin' lie...
"Debbie Does Dallas"...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...
DeJesus...It's got him.
Hardly.
Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
Seven hundred for the pair.
And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; a bit anti-social, you know.
It's happening tomorrow morning. Get back here now.
Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden.
Like antiques.
If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and rob the place.
You get the guns?
Yes?
Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
Jesus Christ!
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.
Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?
About twenty minutes.
Try that one.
All right, Dad.
Sure is.
We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
Er well, yes we do.
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years.
There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy.
Just hold on, I got the keys.
I didn't touch him, he just passed out.
OK, open the gate.
What the fuck is going on?
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!
I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.
Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.
The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him.
. . . What?
A hundred grand.
No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
I want your bar.
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
You know how much it is, Nick.
I think you're Nick the Greek.
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
Er, well, twelve.
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
I'm not talking to you. You don't have any friends.
Just shut up.
They're not going to jail.
They stole our land--
I-I can do the job, sir.
The--the officers.
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.
September '97, that's all she wrote.
That badge--
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?
No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
What?
I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
So that's him--
Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and  all?
But they were Indians themselves.
Well, he's living proof of that, son. Living proof.
Dad--
My father.
You own this place?
Made some money, came back here--
Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!
If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine--
He'll probably be getting a medical discharge--
Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission.
Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
So tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits.
The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
Bandidos, Injuns--
En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
I have some friends who have had a accident--
They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- esta es mi jefa--
Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
He was a unique individual.
Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P--
Hell, everybody heard that story a million times.
We made our collection at Roderick's place and that was the last anybody seen hide nor hair of him.  He went missing the next day, along with ten thousand dollars in county funds from the safe at the jail.
We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--
When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks--
Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, that crowd.
--Santiago.
Right.
All it was wearing was a big old Masonic ring and a Rio County Sheriffs badge.
People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
You ought to put up a banner-- "Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy"--
The Perdido thing?
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
Maybe you're just getting less patient.
Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--
That's me.
Not if I can help it.
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
How much you got left?
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
I thought he busted you a couple times.
Well, you were working there--
You've got your mother, your kids--
Nothing.
Pilar--
She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
I been working on a few things.
Well, it's a complicated issue--
I haven't seen anybody come by.
Another woman?
He's gonna find out.
Nope.
doorway) And who's that?
D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
What do you mean, "all of us?"
Why did you wait so long?
Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared...
I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
And you don't ask questions?
Does that mean...?
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
He's an illusionist.  It's not exactly brain surgery.
I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
Some or it.
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
No it isn't.  You can't help me.
I'm okay.  I'm okay.
Harry-?
Good.  There.  Yes?
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
Somebody killed him.
I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
So could you walk on water?
I'm here to offer you a job.
You know of him?
Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
Probably.
Yes.  It's regrettable
Yeah, I know.
I won't say anything.
Does anybody?
What?
I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
It's me betrayed him.
Will that do?  No?
Is that all?
And you're not?
Is that all?
No.
You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
In my time, and nobody else's.
I don't know.
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.
Fuck you.
Why would I want to?
Yes.
Yes.
No!
These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
I'm here for the week.
Ok.
I know, it's stupid.
No way.
Do you want to have some breakfast?
OK, see you downstairs.
I see them every morning.
I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
No, I was looking at you.
I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
That's ok.
They really have to work on that street name thing.
I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
No.
Around.
Tomorrow.
I don't think so.
That sounds great  can you hold on...  What Zoe?
Ok, well... I love you.
Is there anything I can do?
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
Do you want to- 
Do you want I send it to your room?
No, I thought it was funny. Forget it.
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
Sure.
I got some hair stuff.
Yeah, I think you're probably right... because when you try to...
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky you don't have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've been sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours...
She's a talk show host.  They can't be charmed.  By definition.
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.
What time did you make it for?
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
I'm gonna go make a stink.  Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.
My secretary?
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.
I think I should join you.
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
You weren't there.  Give me time to get some proof.
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
It was blank.  Nothing on it.  You gave me the wrong one.
I had to.
Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ.  So Satan will assume human form.  I believe it too.
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
I'm going to look around.
I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
What's the...OH SHIT!
Your 33rd birthday.  The transformation will be a perversion of Christ's rising from the dead.  Townsend discovered it in one of Lareaux's books.
I don't know.  Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.
I see things.  My worst fears.  You need to know something, Peter.  I was possessed once.  Like Birdson.  It took Father Lareaux six days to pull me out of it.
Only your body will remain.  I believe your soul will be at peace.  If we kill you, Satan can't stay.
What are these?
You have to be experienced to do this. Just wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him.
What did he say to you in French?
Whish the circumstances were different.
Look, John, I'm facing it.
You are the younger of two...
It's Detective Smythe.
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.
Sure thing.  Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  You can go home.  Gimme til morning.  Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh?  Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.
She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans.  Parents died when she was 13.
Nothing.
I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.
Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
I can't eat before a game.
Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
But you use potato?
He's fine.
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
This time get your feet set.
Sort of.
Gotta wait til the press conference.
It's okay.
Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
No one's forcing her.
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
He's in college?
Yeah, right.
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
She hates all freshmen.
No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
Never let a freshman take your spot.
Just like that?
My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
I don't care.
Kay.
For how long?
I know this.  What do you want?
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
God, here we go.
You either.
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
I said fine.
Quit.
Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.
I was.  I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
We won the championship.
Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company.
Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...
Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.
What?
Then why are you so upset?
Business folks.
We still have to go?
Uh, your earring?
We were just studying.
Okay.
Yup.
I don't know, he had a meeting or something.
"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
You know, people.
We need to talk.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
Came by to check on you.
I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.
No.
These adults are tough enough, I think you'll be surprised -- the Mexican's a bit of a question mark --
In my sleep, Burt.
No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
Shut it.  Shut yer fuckin' mouth.
Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
I'm really only equipped to take orders --
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
Oh that's good.
It's a helluva disease.
Please.  It doesn't have to be now. Maybe we can make a date to sit down, I didn't mean to walk in on you like this --
GET OUT.
It's the LAPD, can you open the door, please?
I'm coming!
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
You don't have a boyfriend?
You just move in here?
Bit messy.
-- do you wanna cup?
Arlight, then.  Cheers.
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
yeah, good, ok.
Good bye.
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.
No, no.
...yeah...
What?
Oh my god, Jim. Jim, that was so --
That was so great what you just said.
You don't how fuckin' stupid I am.
Wanna kiss me, Jim?
please, what is it, please --
I want a shot of tequila too.
They're here, they're fine. In the dressing room.  See you later --
It's upstairs.
How much time do we have?
I should maybe go to the bathroom.
-- Richard.
If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.
Stay quiet...stay quiet, son --
No, Son...be quiet...be quiet now...
We're not gonna do that now.  We're not gonna do that now and that's over.
No.
-- watch the mouth, homeboy, I don't need to hear that word --
Finish it up without the lip.
Fine.  Phil, you still there?
Doc, just - don't, how close are you?
This sounds threatening.
And I'm listening avidly, fellow.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
Don't Donnie. Don't do it.
Don't get strong, Donnie. This is making sense, this making a lot of sense. You are not doing the job, the job I ask you to do, a job I give you. Over and over and over and I'm sorry. But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry that much more.
FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
Yes I do.
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
I can help you through this the best I know how but there are certain things you are gonna have to be strong about and take care of, now we can go over them, but I need to know that you're listening to me, ok?
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
-- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that --
I'm trying.
I've seen it before.
How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
Twelve.
So boring, so useless --
In aid of what?
-- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself <u>into</u> --
I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
And that's what you've heard?
My father worked in televison. My mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian.
She's my mother.
He passed away.
people die.
Not a problem.
I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
What name?  My name?
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
"Frank" was my mother's father.
I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
Uh. huh.
...ok...
The door was open, I got a call --
Calm down.
Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
I went out last night.
I didn't hear anything.
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.
I got in trouble at school.
Find her, get her and tell her I want to talk to her, Mary.  Fucking hell.
Jean Baptiste Poquelin Moliere.
As fast as I can.
I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --
Paula.  Ellen.
How long with Ellen?
What about now?
Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
Maybe...I don't...
<u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
I'II go....is it...back here?
It's alright.
I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
When they want us done, they'll call in the Harvard S.W.A.T team or some shit.
No they don't --
I don't wanna do it.  Why can't one of you do it --
Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
You need to sober up.
....it's alright....
...I don't....
Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.
I'd like to get an order of...um...peanut butter.
That's it.
We need more dog food --
I didn't know the answer --
Stand up.
Alright.
Go to bed.
Hi.
....Why does he do it...?
I have money.
It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
I understand you saved my son's life today.
Nothing... Nothing.
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
I am with you!
Tomorrow.
Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
The secret I carry I cannot share. Not even with God.
Everyone back.
Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane.  If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river?
Easy to say, but hard to do.  For what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France.
I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.
No, not Louis!
What use am I?
We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.
At a ball, everyone watches the King!
He lures us to capture.
Athos, my friend!
If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
Get out of my way.
To kill the king.
I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot.
D'Artagnan...
Phillippe.  Rest now.
At least help Raoul.
Yes, your Majesty.
Get out of my way.
Thank you, Keeper.
Yes, yes, go on.
The corridor nullifies our number... And no one has stomach to fight the Captain.
Shoot them!  Shoot them!
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
Sire, I --
How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
I did not want to upset you.  It was tragic.  I did everything I could for him.  I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting.  But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger.
What do you need?
Where are you?
Did you report it stolen?
we've got kidnapping, grand theft auto, burglary, and two counts of murder on you, and I'm gonna see to it personally that it sticks!
I didn't hit shit!
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
Right behind you.
Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?
When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
It's just...catching up with me, you know?
And who are you?
I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.
She stole my car!!
Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
Seattle.
No.
Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
What happened with the tape?
Yeah.
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
I killed them.
They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
OK...where do you want to start?
I knew I could count on you.
How about Marvosa and the others?
What else is new?
Both at the same bank...
I'm not going anywhere!
I told you I'm not going anywhere! I got my whole life in this place!  I'll just destroy the evidence and play dumb.
I'm going to need a way to get there.
We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
Screw him!
Did you have sex with her?
County jail - get in.
I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot.  That's what you were thinking, isn't it?
He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.  I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr. Leeds.
That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
Twenty minutes max.
Issue the toilet paper tear as a...
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
Read it.
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
What's one way?
Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
You.
Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
I'll pick you up in...
I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
There's no connection between the families.
What?
Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
Are your parking permits in the computer? He drives a van.
Let's get to the physical.
It'll do fine.
No, thanks. I manage very well.  I'll order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow.
I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
Me.
I don't want to know.
Yes.
Oh, God.
God, no.
No.
No.
Hi, Linda. ..
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
Atlanta and Birmingham.
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
Goodbye.
Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
Huh?  Will? Is that you?
Tell me about yourself.
I have to see somebody.
Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
I love you...
Good for him.  Thanks a lot, Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.
You haven't smoked in two years.
I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...
I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
You going back down to Florida after?
What's that?
Go on to the house.
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
...after a while.
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
Very interesting, even to a layman.
You read about it, I'm sure.
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...
Yes. I'd considered it.
I haven't decided yet.
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
What do you want?
It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful...
...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
I hope you have a second chance...
Tank you veddy much.
It's a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea.  It sunk. GEORGE Oh.  Hm.  I'm uh, sorry.  Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting.  If you ever need representation... we should talk.
And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
What's up?
Yeah, we can have a garage sale. "Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!"
Okay... I'll go back.  But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka.  They're gettin' Tony!
Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
But wasn't it funny?
No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!  Carnegie Hall...!
You've got good days and bad days.
Yeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing!  He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
Andy!
Twenty!
These kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials.  Now for sure they're gonna fire me, so if you want to see me again, you'll have to come to Memphis...
Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
No thanks.
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
I can shtop whenever I want...
Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what we're known for!  "Maui?  "Wowie!"
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
Then your father's a wimp.
No!  Andy, don't do it --
Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes...
I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life...
Yes, your Holiness?
Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here.
Oh.
I'll take my chances!!
I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places.
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?!  I was the one saying I didn't believe it!
What's your name?
We have no choice but to continue as planned.  Deploy the sentinels. Immediately.
No way.  Not possible.
What?
If you get caught using that --
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
... Yeah.
Any time.
Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.
Goddamnit!
Go.
... Yes.
You could say that.
This can't be...
More important than what is when?
A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
Because... I didn't think I would?
I think I do.
No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
What's going on?
She would say she knows enough.
Yes.
Morpheus, I don't know --
He is the One.  He is the One!
How did you know...?
Who?
Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
What?
That's different.
Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
It might have been.  I'm not sure.
A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.
What choice?
I have to.
I'm not the One, Trinity.  The Oracle hit me with that too.
I believe I can bring him back.
Yeah?
It wasn't fast enough.
Deep underground.  Near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  You live long enough, you might even see it.
They're hacking his mind.
He's alive.
I'll be all right.
Hurry, Neo.
Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
Look fella...this is private...
Let go of her.
Ok.  Wait here.
'Take a little tip from Mack the Knife...'
You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know.  Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
'Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?'
Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
Yeah.
How about Teresa?  I could talk...
And say what?
Thanks for the ride.
Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
Giovanino!  Where have you been?
Should I slap him?
No, she isn't.
Don't worry.  I can handle it.
What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
I could have told you that.
Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
Me?  I wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle...or even your uncle, Charlie...
What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
I'll be here.  Don't worry.
He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
No.
What pipes?
I don't understand, where's Groppi?
OK, get in.
All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
I know.
What do they expect you to say?
What was it?
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
It's all right.
A paper on that one too?
Sure...He lives there?
I know...I know.
But...
The girls like it loud.
Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
Sal!... fourteen street.
Well...no.
You what?
Friends of yours Michael.
You think so?
Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
Love that name.
He's cute.
Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
Yes, it is.
Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer.
Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
Right away.
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?
Here...
Do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies?
Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. I did cheat on that exam at Groton. But so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today.  And I'm expecting you won't mention it again.  I don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but I'm willing to pretend I did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones.  But can I tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him.  What are you, his shadow?  Do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak?  You know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with W.P.  That means without you.  Okay, pal?  Let's eat.
I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --
A voice?
Like a marriage made in heaven?
What do you mean?
But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
How nice for you both.
As much as Joe's?
If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.
I'm just giving you the truth.  There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth.
Certainly, Bill.
But who is he?  What are his creden- tials?  What is his relationship to you?
Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.
The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
I don't think they're ordinary.  I love keychains.
Are you?
How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?
That we did.  Thanks to you.  He was wobbling, mind you, but you spplied the coup de grace.
The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard.  Would you like to hear the silver lining?  Check that, gold.  I've been working with John Bontecou all along.  We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder.  I set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park.
Make it time.
None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.
Hi, Jennifer.
Sure.
Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
Good morning, Jennifer.
Are you?
Love.
'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
I'm lost.
I'm sorry.
Peanut butter.
I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
And I appreciate you, too.
To bed.
I said get out.
Please.  We don't need to talk about Drew.
I am.
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
Don't.  That will come later.
Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
It's a saying.
Yes, that's why I said it.
-- Yes?
Thank you.
Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
Good morning, Bill.
Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we had last night.  I felt as if I were being treated like a person.  'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly.
I guess so.
Yes, Bill.
That's what everybody says.
Can you keep a secret?
So can I.
Are you sad, Bill?
Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A little Coleman's mustard.
Why didn't you stop me?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
I think you heard me, Bill.
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
Well, they're mine now.
With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
And we're very grateful.
'Yes' is the answer to your question.
I don't!
There's going to be plenty of time for that.
No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
Hi, honey.
...Then don't.
So what's wrong with that?
'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
Then what will you say?
What are you afraid of, Dad?  That I'll fall head over heels for Joe -- well, I have -- as you did with Mom.  That's always been standard, whether you like or not.
I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
Not at all.  It was fascinating.
What's the way?
I agree --
You never know.  Lightning could strike.
This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.
I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!
I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway.
Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.
Just loud enough to wake me up.
No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
That's the thing. I have this condition.
What's it like?
As requested.
What?
Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
Yeah?
That's right I did, didn't I?
* I'm not too good on the phone. I need to		    * look people in the eye when I talk to			  * them.							    *
Thanks.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Don't say anything else.
Quiet!
But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes.
What happened?
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
Maybe I can help you find him. I know a			* lot of people.
And what did he say?
Where is he?
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
Can I ask you something?
What do you want?
Who's your boyfriend?
Did Teddy send you?
Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
Then why are you here?
Thank you.
Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
I guess I've told you about my condition.
So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
You don't have to remember to be hungry.
Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?
The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right?
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
Probably left it in your room.
No. No, just let me think for a minute.
Shut it, Teddy.
I'll ride with him. You follow.
Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy.
From who?
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you.
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.
Wouldn't be appropriate.						*
You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone who'll listen. "Remember Sammy Jankis, remember Sammy Jankis". Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember?
I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'		   * Jimmy down there.
Yes, I will.
No. You took them out.						  *
My mother calls me Teddy. I'm John Edward Gammell. Cheer up, there's a lot of John		    * G's for us to find. All you do is moan.			* I'm the one that has to live with what			 * you've done. I'm the one that has to put		    * it all together. You just wander around			* playing detective. You're living a dream,		   * kid. A dead wife to pine for and a sense		    * of purpose to your life. A romantic quest		   * which you wouldn't end even if I wasn't			* in the picture.							    *
Quit it!							 * 					   * You're not a killer, Lenny. That's why			 * you're so good at it.						   *
His name's James F. Grantz, John G. Check		   * your tattoos.							 *
Grieve elsewhere.
"And" what?
They may have already, so we protect the living.  Proof she's alive?
Good.
Three wakes off the back of those boats.  Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull?
You can't.
I mean <u>full</u> disclosure.
I'm a fiend for mojitas.
I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel...  And I can do anything I want...
Okay.  Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know, now...it's all business...
"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
Of course.
This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
...it's gonna be an L-shaped ambush.  They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors, 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They <u>will</u> wait till they got the goods before they do the deed.
I'm also called "Cochi Loco."  That means "Crazy pig."  'Cause I enforce security and get people to tell me what I need to know.  That part of what I do, you never want to find out about.  Other people will negotiate the money and go or not go.  Not me...
I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view.  I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now...
Skin has to touch skin.  That's the requirement for the warrant.  Then he makes a credible excuse and he stops....  Her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security...
What happened to the last transporter you <u>had</u>?
Nothing.
Port-Au-Prince.
Who knows...
No.
Nothing.
No.
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
Chill out Sonny.
You think I am in so deep I forgot?
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
What's the point?  It's going down.
Twenty on my man...
Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
How do I discuss operations over an open line?
NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
To recruit you.
A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think.
I'm my <u>own</u> man.  And anytime you want to see how much man I am?
We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
Switek pulling this off...?  That's not faith; that's delusional...
What's it say?
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
Not French registry?
They're serious.  They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good.
Maritime.  Jose will fill you in.
You work that out with La Senora.  You will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the Malaysian ship.  For collection in North Miami.  You warehouse it. Release it when we say.  I'm sure you have friends with fast boats...
I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!
No, ma'am, I'm not.
Yeah, oh yeah.
Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.
I ain't sleepy.
What? It's a perfectly good word, ain't it. How much time I got?  Goddam sand thing drive you crazy. Kee-rist. Spelling never was a very strong point with me. Even in school.
Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't mind if I do.
Hold it, just hold it. You think I'm that kinda sombitch? Just name your cut, whatever you want, you got it right now. Five? Ten, how's that?
Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
Now take it. Go on.  Listen, where can I reach you? Cause I'm gonna make this right with you soon's I get me set up...
Whatsa matter now?
Well now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you something for your own good, only first gimme a cigarette.
Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
So if you want me to hang around for a few days, I thought you should know.
What's all this sweet talk about Florida? Your friend O'Daniel got a stable down there now?
And end up a hunchback like my old man? You think I'm crippled? You shoulda caught him the end of a day.
What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make a cowboy outta you, kid. How about that? Build you up a little, teach you couple little tricks'n turn y'out to stud, Rat-stuff.
Rico. Rico Rizzo.
What of?
I'm going to Florida, that's my only chance.
I don't even want you to go. Whaddya think of that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City. It's laughable.
Gin's okay.
What?
Oh. Yes. Of course. I should have thought. You shouldn't have to ask. That was thoughtless of me. Yes. Wait here...
You bet I do, sir.
Yessir, I can see that.
Uh, yessir.
Ready for anything.
Getchmis...?
Where?
You want to split your hernia again?
Stop shitting me, man!
And what do you do when you in the catacombs?
About ten kilometers.
Very bad now. Maybe war. Those Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus again ) How'd you lose your friends?
I'll pay extra
Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
Something like that. Cigarette?
I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be.
Twelve years.
Thank you.
What do you mean?
What's that?
I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter.
Section 13?
Yeah.
Yeah!
Then I'll cut his balls off.
You know where it is?
Maybe he's changing jobs.
My passport!
Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.
Who?
What's your name?
Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?
Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?
Shit.
Weird shit...?
Mole people. This section was pretty popular, all the way to Fulton Street...
H-how do I get...?
Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
"Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?
The kid's with them!!
Hurry, the woman needs help!
Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere...  Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her.
Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
We're down to a "couple" now, huh?
Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
We?
Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!
Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
Listen to me:  we're getting you out.
They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
Try not to sweat?
Jump in.
Just like Trump Tower, then.
Oh, Jesus.
Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way...
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain.  Like a baby.  All done. 
Nothing.
It's fine.
The phones are working?
My daughter must be going nuts.
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
Misery?
Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly.
Well, I hope you like it.
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
Perfect.
I don't know.
You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.
It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.
No, just the paper will be fine.
--not fair?
What?
Yeah, yeah...
...have to wait.
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
It is.
Maybe.
I'm glad you like it.
What? What is it?
Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things.
Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.
What?
Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
So do I...
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.
I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.
All done, chief..
Well that depends.
How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
Ahh..
Then don't say it.
To do what?
Yes.  We won't be able to have dinner tonight.  Something's come up.  I hope you don't mind.
What are you talking about?
In downtown Sydney for a start.
Sit down.  You'll be a billionaire.  Better than being broke.  I've got terrorists and other pharmaceutical companies standing in line.  Ball's in your court, Mr. McCloy.
And you're happy about that?
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
Somebody's been slipping you our mail. Come on out here, you bad girl.
It's okay.  She scrambled the transmission.  Luther, continue feeding the GPS her position.
Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
I'll be damned.  It's McCloy, the Biocyte CEO.
What are you talking about?
There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?
Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
Ethan Hunt.
Care to wait a decent interval?
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
Just about..
I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.
I'm infected with Chimera.  You know you don't have a choice.  Just do it now.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Like?
Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
- right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.
Go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman.  She's got all the training she needs.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
She sacrificed herself..
Yes.
Yes, I'm sorry too.. 'You're sorry and I'm sorry..'  - you do know Gradski thought the world of you.
No.  After you've lived with <i>Chimera</i> for twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not even...<i>Bellerophon.</i>
You keep calling me Dmitri.  You really shouldn't.
You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..
No garage entrance.  Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.
I'm not waiting 48 hours.  When we're done at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's, I'm going in and getting her out.
What's happening here?  You're dead!
'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with <i>Chimera</i> needed it as well.
By asking me.
You know, I think it's a little late for that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.
You're right, of course.
Yes, Anatoly, yes.
All ten million.
Always.
We got it.  On your feet.
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
Of course - Im sorry to hear you say that Claire.
This stuff is so sticky.
Theyre dead.
You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
Why was there another team?
Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset.
Now I want you to hold onto it.
I'll get you close.
Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
Roger that.  Opening doors now.
What about my coat?  I'll freeze.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
Why?
Very well.
Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
If you were me, Ethan, who would <u>you</u> trust to make him believable?
<u>Negative</u>, Golitsyns on the move.
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Im dead and gone.  God knows what shes had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..
Youre probably right.
And get a doctor.
That's not so good for you, my friend.
I know, I am so sorry for so many things. I love you, Moira. I love you. I love you.
You're rich as Roosevelt. You're just cheap, Cosmo.
He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die.
I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going.  You should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.
His brother.
Bed.
I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.
What's your news?
What killed him?
I didn't give you away the first time.
Let's go tell your Mother.
They are little stars and birds. Birds fly to the stars, I guess.
I like your dress.  It's very bright.
You have too many dogs.
Hurry up.
I don't know what to advise my son. I think he should pay for the wedding, but it is important that he don't look ridiculous.
I'm going to marry him.
I know that. I do what I want.
Yesterday.
Why what?
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
Stupid.
Just Johnny.
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
No!
Get all of me. Take everything.
I can't!
But he wants me to come!
I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
Awful?
I think that's it.
How can you ask me that?
I know what I know.
Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!
Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri!
Bobo, take the cart away.
I don't understand.
On the floor?
A week. Two weeks. No more.
How about a month from today?
I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.
How was your plane ride?
We should talk alone.
Well. I told my mother that we were to be married. And she got well. Right away.
No.
Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat.  Where's that card?
Where you been?
Where's pop?
Did you see it?
Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!
Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked my advice. If he asks my advice, I don't know what I will say.
Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
I will. But I must find the right moment.
I came right from the airport.
It was a miracle!
What happened?
It's nothing!
Will you join me for dinner?
What do you do?
That woman was a student of yours?
There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
Is who down there?
You see that moon last night?
Oh. Right.
Quiet! Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!
...What?
I'm not interested.
He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
Who are they?
NI!
I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
You said it again!
I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.
No, it isn't.
Had enough ... ?
Come, Patsy.
Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
I'm French.  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king.
|      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!
Yes, my liege.  Stand by for attack!!
A G...g...g...
What?
It is the rabbit.
I've said I'm sorry about the old woman, but from the behind you looked ...
Well ... I AM king.
Course it's a good idea.
... Well, we did do the nose.
If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
I'm not dead!
Do me a favour.
What is your name?
Yes he is.
He hasn't got shit all over him.
Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
Oh, don't worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn't Camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?
But, Father, I don't really want any of that.
I'm ... your son ...
I was saved at the last minute.
Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.
No ... just keep him in here.
The Prince ... ?
Camelot ...
I don't think I was.
No, I'm not.
Back to your bed!  At once!
You've come to rescue me?
I am, sir. I am a Knight of King Arthur.
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
That's pretty good for a ghillie.
I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs.  I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping me now.
I've got my duties to attend to.
You watch your tongue.
Of course.
It's so infernally cold in here.
... Least of all my son.  It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave.
That's a tautology lad.  If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally.  That's understood.
That's not good enough.
Aye, do.
You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
There are important papers from --
I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen.  It was remiss of me not to come earlier.
I don't think about it.
I'm not married.
I wouldn't know.
What I do, I do for my Queen.
I do what I do.
In time, she will.
But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
Ma'am.
I am.
I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
Yes, ma'am?
Yes, ma'am.
The Queen forbids it.  I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please.
Have I ever let you down before--?
Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.
No, ma'am.
My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.
So?
I hope he got his mother's permission.
You can't know that for sure.
Excellent!
Yes.
Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.
No, indeed.
Why am I being lectured in this way?!
I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
A few days, ma'am.
What is it?
From whom?
My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
He has typhoid fever, ma'am.
Getting there.  It's more sensitive than a joy-stick.  Your video-character can respond as fast as you can.  But what can I do for you?
Well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype.
Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.
How'd you know it was us?
We are talking...
Funny.
Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.
You imagined it.
No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.
We can't...
What?
I can't believe you made it!
A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
Yes I am...
What?
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
Right, then...
We don't have a choice!
I just thought of something.  If we came back from the game...  ...what if ARCADE did too?
I know.
Yes...
Then we'll go home.
You have no time.  What is your question?
You have no time.
Fucked up.  That's what they said I was.
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
Give her a chance, will you?
No.
I'm going home.
I'm going home. I'll call you later.
There is no problem.
Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
Howdy to you.
Whatever.
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
How's that?
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
I was afraid of that.
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
Yes.
Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
What?
Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.
But you won't.
May I have your name please?
But it said #12.
If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.
You don't remember anything else?
Mulholland Drive?
We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
Come on... let's find you something to wear.
We'll take our check.
I'm not sure about this.
"I can call them... I can call my dad... "
"What about you? What will your dad think about you?"
"Then they'd put you in jail."
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.
Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
Not a coke or anything?
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
I'm an investment banker. I see blood bathes everyday. Besides, mine is not to question why, min is but to do or die.
Why should I ?
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
No where. We've got about seven minutes before this thing slams into a concrete wall.
I'm working on it.
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
Why would he ? His parents are rich.
I'd say about thirty to forty minutes. Give or take a few.
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
This is New York. No one notices anyone. Not even when someone disappears. At first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal McCay's Jag. Then it was dirty accountants that tried to walk away with millions. The Old Man got such a rush from it, I thought that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after hours.
Well, surprise, surprise, I've been on the payroll for several years now. I still have an office and secretary. No one even batted an eyelash. Do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in New York ?
Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
A dragon.
Are you hunting wabbits ?
That's cute asshole.
Knock yourself out.
What ? Are you my mother ?
Yes, sir Mom. 
And who bailed you out when a hit was put on you, you sorry sack of shit. Who put you up ? Who gave you a job ?
So ?
Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
Checking..... Hah ! He has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets...
I'm sick of playing. I've got a better idea.
For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question ?
I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.
Son, let's watch the tape.
Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.
Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
Better, sir.
I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?
Just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life.
He'll never make it out of the park alive. I promise you that....
I'll see that bet.
Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
Yes. I think he's feeling sick or something.
<<belch>>
Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far.
Thank you.
Sure.
Thank you.
Yes, Excuse me for a second.
If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?
Maybe all that testosterone plugs his ears.
What ?
We made it !
Where are we ?
Who was that guy anyway ?
No.
Good morning.
Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
Ohhhhh.
Your Uncle Phil told me.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
What about giving the other guy a break.
I thought I told you to lose this guy.
You're still asking me to break the law.
What do you remember about her.
You kidding? he picks up a picture and shows Vada and Nick
His name is Jeffrey Pommeroy and he used to drive a 54 Ford pickup, black with red interior. Please?
Hello, I'm gonna need this right now...this guy...well we think he might be going after the governor.  Twenty minutes? Fine.
Great.
Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over anxious, so if you think there's a boy that might like you, let him know that you like him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk when he's thinking of asking you out.
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
Totally groovy huh?
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Phil's moving to LA, Grammoo's passing, the baby being born, Vada's report, I think...
I remember Maggie...and your Dad too, you know we used to all pile into his old 54 Ford pickup. &quot;Chuck the Truck&quot; we used to call it.
I'd like to, thanks.
You are?
I've got something better.
We performed on the beach one summer...ha...everything went wrong.
You should be here when they bring in a body that's been dead for a couple of days, and they haven't found it yet, 'cause it was in an apartment, and no-one came to visit, or floating in a river, and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green, you know, like watery pea soup? The arms and legs deteriorate first, the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why I'm seriously considering cremation. Judy??
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
I don't know. And I don't care, Kevin's a jerk and I don't like him anymore. He's all yours!
Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
O.K. Thank you very much.
I want juice!
I won't.
And you're gonna solve the mystery?
Just remember the needle in the haystack.
What difference does it make?
Change my name.
What if you don't wanna be found?
Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?
He is one of the great poets.
At least it gives you plenty of exercise.
Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
Give it to me!
Owh...
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
What do you think?
And you'd be my cousin?
But we wouldn't really be related right?
Good. I mean...
You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.
I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
Ten bucks.
Oh what can I say Phil, it's just that I feel so welcome here.
That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
Yes, it does.
Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way.
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
Sounds like you're very organized.
Oh I see, 'cause usually that doesn't require such a lengthy consultation.
Phil for God sake.
Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?
Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding.... A gentleman, would choose British racing green, with maybe a tan interior...but when you buy a red car, with a black interior and wire wheels, you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and I'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is...in front of the children.
There's plenty of fruit.
What, did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut.
She'll be all right baby.
Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
You couldn't?
All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.
Oh, sure okay.
Everybody did, walk along Citrus between Fountain and Sunset any afternoon.
Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
This is the street he walks down every day. When he needs inspiration...
I like to buy off all the railroads.
Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.
Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.
Can't stay, I'm just here because my wife.....
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.
Yeah, all right...
My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
I think it's still available.
That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm.  Fix it.
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
What's that?
It's nice.
Here?
Is there enough room?
Goodnight.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
Dad?
I love this guy! 
Can I go too?
Sorry.
No, sweetie, not yet.
I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
There were just too many of 'em.
I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
Hi, is Vada home?
Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
That's Suzanne.  She and I are gonna be married this Fall.
You know what I think? I think Vada's very lucky to have a friend like you.
After your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny.
Oh.
Can I use your bathroom first?
Come here, sit down.
Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
Oh great!!
I will I promise.
What are you saving for?
That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
Hi Mr. Bixler!
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
What?
Hey, where does it say that?
Yes.
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
Don't DO that!!
I stopped that!
What?
You're right, let's knock it down.
But I have my clothes on!
I wanna live with them too.
I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past this place two times already. We're not getting nowhere.
You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.
Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go swimming?
No.
Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.
Well, then, I'll take it up with her.
Well, I'm close to her.  I wanted to meet the one that got away.
I honestly wish I could...
Part of being a New Yorker.
Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...
Desperate.  To talk.
Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
You like her.
And you believe that.
Impressive.
The man you love.
Someday she'll thank you.
I can't even say it.
It's too late to start over.
To belong to someone.
Hey, handsome.  Brevity this...
... you hate weddings, you never go.
He said that, too.
... just my bridal shower.  And Michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at Comiskey for a one-thirty game.
... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...?
Ju...
Probably am.  Forget I brought it up.
I just don't want to freak him out.
We settled this.  And I reneged. That wasn't fair.
... that this is all my fault?
... look good on Kimberly.
... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
Nice meeting you, too, Walt.
I think you're making a mistake, sir.
It doesn't say th...
He's too proud to beg for help. And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. Completely humiliating.
Nobody has.  So far.
I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people...
Quite the little eccentric.
Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?
You keep saying that.
No.  I've got you.
It's more than that.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know?  You forget you... chose it.
ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
She admits it's her fault.
Shhh.
This is the dumbest thing I will ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that I can't.  I don't think.
Lower.
The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.
I came here, looking for her.
I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
... and you knew about this.
Well, forgive me for screwing up your plans!
Well, if that's the way you f...
With those big, dark, haunted eyes. As if you were harborin' some... unspeakably... guilty... secret.
Right here.
What?
You're so good.
How did you come in here?
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
Green.
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
She's going to rest now.
Okay. Thanks.
How is that?
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
Who the hell is he?
Third party?
What!
Hi. Come on in. Mary!
President.
Sue was trying to get hold of you.
What crook?
Not yet.
I'll just be in here.
It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
Well, he's really amazing.
I don't really know what you're talking about.
No.
No.
No.
Nash.
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
Does their hair fall out?
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
Bye.
Yes, it is --
About three years.
Linnea?
I'm here.
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
Well, they removed my heart last week, but I'm doing fine except my nose fell off. Looks a little funny.
Hi.
What do you mean?  You said you wanted to see me.
Wow!
I can't.
I'm not sure.
Well...
What?
What...?  0h, yes.
Eight-thirty in the chapel.
Thanks. You are just a wonderful person.
He's pretty well known down here.
Sleeping.
Out.
Oh?
Mary?
Did it break?
Do you study at all?
Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
Just a minute.
Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
Who?
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
I'll be dammed.
Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?
Is that good?
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
Yes you are.
Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.
Yes, you are.
What...
Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.
We still got a few tricks up our sleeves.
What he said. We didn't know jack shit about and riot. It just happened. It was kismet. We didn't even know those people. How are we supposed to organize a riot when we've been in fuckin' isolation for the past year? Just bleep out the fucks and jack shits.  I mean, it's not like we care. If they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep us up at night. But you said you wanted the truth, and the truth is we were just lucky.
The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need.
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
The prison board and the doctors who examined them.
Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.
So, how do I fit into this scheme?
By all means.
She was born without a tongue.
Tough titty, it's mine now.
Not good.
Everybody knows who you are. You're famous.
Whose ratings were higher?
How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
How 'bout Manson?
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
She sings? What does she sing?
Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head? Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that?
Sure.
Out front.
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
Yes.
No. Not really.
No fuckin' way!
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
Just for fun, I guess.
They actually apologized.
I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
Thanks.
Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey.
Wayne Gayle.
Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
Yeah, sure.
Would the network really not run it without the interview?
Okay.
Perfecto!
Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that thought. Reload, quick!
See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?
Lose 'em.
Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
I can't do that. Five guys.
Don't call my men assholes.
You in a big hurry, boy?
That dyin's gonna be done two ways.
Used to be. On the railroad.
I'll smile when it's funny.
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
Okay.
You work around town?
Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.
You don't think much of yourself, do you?
You keep asking me why I'm here.
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
Don't Duff--
You almost got into trouble back there.
Why did you?
No.
That's the way he is.
Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.
Are you married?
Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
I thought you wasn't comin'.
Okay, I guess.
Just what I said. Don't look so scared.
She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over.  Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
Well, what d'you think?
Don't call them that.
Come here, baby.
You jivin' me?
We'll be all right.
Yeah.
They won't.
Water pump's busted. I don't know if it's worth fixin', but I need that car.
What the hell could you do?
What're you going to do?
There's nothing to say.
You'll be better off without me. I ain't fit to live with no more. It's just like a lynchin'. Maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
Why don't you relax, Frankie?
What 'you signifyin'?
Yeah. That's right, Jocko.  Those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them.
What's on your mind?
Plannin' on getting married?
'Don't sound so sure.
Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.
What's the matter? Don't smell so good, huh? Must'a broken some records.
Sorry.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
Whenever he's got an edge on.
Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
Sure.
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
Guess it's never been easy.
How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
I guess I ain't.
I guess not.
Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
How you doin'?  Hi there!
Hi.
What's the matter?! You mad at me?
Okay, so what's a girl supposed to do? Me not workin' and her cleanin' house for a white man. I'm tellin' you, boy, keep away from marriage. Ya gotta stay light on your feet or you won't make it.
What's the matter now?
I will.  Inside.  There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
Of course.
No. I only needed the code from you.
And how do you suggest I do that?
You son of a bitch...
The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
I've arranged for him to work with us.
You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
Yeah.
Yeah. That was me.
I an' I, man. I an' I.
The girl 3Jane. We need her.
Jah guides us.
Right...
What?
I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
We got problems topside.
I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.
How long, Dixie?
I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.
Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.
What's my end?
Then, fuck you. I'm gone.
Couple of months.
What?
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
If the splices aren't good, you could fry.
Too late?
They'll cut you down.
I know you have. C'mere.
No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.
Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
Perversity, darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.
Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
 uhh, must have forgotten-
Well I'm so glad that you guys are.
YOU KNIT?
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
Anita, remember espadrilles?
That is lingerie.

Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
Rosalind and Orlando.  From "As You Like It"?  Shakespeare?
So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.
But I don't want it straightened out.
You're a sick puppy, Geller.
Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!
Have you been there?
Have you been to any parties?
Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this.
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
Hey. There.
But I'm not a penguin.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
I can't do this.
Yes, desperately.
Better than I...
Really?
True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
Oh I don't think so.
Thank you.
I know.
That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--
Do you think you'll find her?
Thanks. So do you.
You were attracted to me?
Wait, I was going to tell you--
I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.
Nah uh.
We're very evolved.
Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
Well, a ball player.
Yeah. Definitely.
Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.
Lock.
Just what?
Whatever it is, it's none of your concern.
He's conducting experiments of his own.
<i>                      -- A box? --        Is it steel? --                     Are there locks? -- Is it filled with a pox? --                          A pox! -- How delightful, a pox!</i>
<i>                      Now and forever...</i>
It's not the gas, Dad!
And you don't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing?
Oh, please...
Ken!
Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?
He's dead, you bitch.
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
He must've been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa.  In the shower!  Left bloody footprints all over the...
I'm sorry...
Just watch me.  If anything weird happens - like if I start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here, you gotta try to bring me out of it. his me over the head if you have to. Just don't let me leave.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Who?
I don't know.
My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.
I'm not hungry.
What are you gonna do?  How are you gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.  I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
We'll figure it out together.  We'll stay up all night if we have to.  I won't let anything happen to you.
Hi.
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
That's right.  I don't.
Can't it wait till morning?
Research.
I don't know.  I'm busy with school. New friends.  But I'll never forget the old ones.
Do you still...see each other?
You did it the other night.
You never lose a gift like that.  You just forget how to use it.  How about it?  Will you try?
I don't do that shit.
That's not true.  You're the one who's trying to forget.
I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.
What's that supposed to mean?
Didn't get much sleep.
Sorry.
Sounds like a rough time.
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
Doesn't matter.
I can do that.
Remember -- open mind.
Everybody take five.
There's nothing we can do.  It's out of our hands.
I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.
No...
Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer before he died.  After he died, he became ...something worse.  Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong.
I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.
A young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays.  The inmates managed to keep her hidden for days.  She was raped...hundreds of times. When they found her, she was barely alive...and with child.
Don't worry, it won't come to that.
Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome.
For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.
And you.  I'll wait till you've gone before I tell him you're a vegetarian.
I'm delighted.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
Fifteen million dollars.
Fine.
Really?
No thanks.
No.
Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
Hi.
Oh -- Okay.
And what happens next in the dream?
Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
I thought you were leaving.
This is the place.
Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
My son's name is Johnny?
Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
Okay.
No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
Who was Gilda?
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
Don't ask.
Undressed like this, yes.
I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
Thank you.  Shall I...
Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.
Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
Anna Scott?
The movie star?
Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Right. 
Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
Yes -- sort of...
What?
It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
Ah... yes, enormously.
Any bit in particular?
Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
How about Miss Flintstone?
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
Two?  That's it?
Absolutely not.
What?
Well, there are.  And we don't need to go anywhere near that far.  My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective.
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
So?
No, Miss Ratched...
Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...
Y-y-y-yes...
I-I-I...
Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss Ratched. I really am.
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
Go on...
No way.
But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
Thank you, ma'am.
Why, thank you, ma'am...  Whew. Man, I tell you, that place up there is somethin' else!  Well, ya boys been practicin' up for the big game?  I figured as much...
Please see to Mister Bromden.
Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway...
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
Go ahead! Go back!
Ease up on the star drag, keep the tie up, up and work hell outta that fella.
C-C-Come here and l-look at th this!
Yeah...
Are they all crazies?
Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
Through the ass.
Me too...
My feet hurt...
Your buddy is callin' ya.
Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
That's between me an' myself. So why don't you boys just shove off. I got some planning to do.
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
I don't trust you!
No!
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
What's this?
Hit me.
Me, too! Me, too!
Me too! Me too!
Hold it!
Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.
I see.
Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.'  What do you think of that report?
Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.
What's the horse pill for, honey?
'Kay!
Are you a doctor?
Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
Oh, yeah?
I don't believe it...
Shhh!  This way!
'Kay...
Come an' see.
Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
Hi.
Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load.
I don't have any.
I'm sure you will.
Tha's your problem.
Yes, Miss Ratched!
Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour job, ma'am...
Yes, ma'am...
Yes, ma'am...
He's dead.
Oh, yeah...
No, she wasn't my sister.
Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
Why?
So.  How do we get to Rome?
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
No.
Dwayne?
Ask her if she knows where he is?
Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
No.
No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
Non.  Please.
Hm.
Yes.
What?
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
Who says I don't love him?...
Tell me.
Right now?
Hi.
You found him.  I don't know how to thank you.
I just wanted to keep an eye on you.  The guy's a total stranger, remember?
The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.
I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
No.  Course not.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
What?
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
Tonight?
You would?  Really?
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
Oh, hello.
A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
So, what's your point?
Is he married?
Is he gay?
I don't know, Kate.
I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect?  Well, guess what?... It isn't.  Not for you, not for anybody.
Larry brought me flowers last night.
No...  I can just tell.
Because you were afraid to fly.
How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
Are you sure?
You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
What is it?
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.
I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
Because I'm the one who's single.
Sure you did.
Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?
Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him.
Packing.
He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
Is Damon Bradley here?
I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
When you could've found one in America.
Uh huh.
Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
And Larry?...
I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
Kate.
I thank you.
He missed me.
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
She didn't give me a chance.
Mania.
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But two thousand dues-payin' members in my local that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out we take our cut.
Gimme.
So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.
And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
I don't know I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I could have been better!
Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.
Okay I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in.
Hello, Edie.
Tommy, what happened?
You training to be a nun or something?
What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
I only live up there and across the roof.
I don't know.
I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested in pigeons.
The things that go on.
How do you like it?
I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But I didn't stay in shape and  I had to take a few dives.
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.
You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
I know... I know... .
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
Get away from me.
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
I'm looking for Charley. I heard Charley was waiting for me.  Charley?
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
He's going to have to grow up too.
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.
I'll find you a priest.
What are you going to do?
A question of who rides who.
You go to hell.
Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.
Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but
I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
Well, it'll be worth it if we can tell the waterfront story the way the people have a right to hear it. Don't you think?
Such as what?
I told you lay off.
No.
Take it easy now, Terry.
Takin' over this local, you know it took a little doin'. Some pretty tough fellas were in the way. They left me this  to remember them by.
By way of Chicago?
It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.
Now just a minute, I
Go on, beat it!
When we knock off let's have a bit of a party. We'll drink to God and Ireland, its whiskey and its women, to Joey and Edie  and death to tyrants everywhere... .!
Patrick, me lad, I'm ahead of you.
Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.
One of these days.
Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back.
It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.  Nothing alive looks like that!
Don't let them hear you.
Nothing is worth your life.
Yes I feel it in my bones.
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
Maybe so.
It would seem so, Master
Ahh, she will be yours.
Ahh, there is yet time.
Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
I will decide the conclusion.
Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
Yes, Master.
You know better than that.
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
I'm so frightened.
I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
Till they got busted.
Thank you.
Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the Mayishan was my name.
Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't bother you no more.
He ain't the problem, Jack.
I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
Now you're talkin'.
Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now, works out at the Kronk.
Love is funny.
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
Forty-five minutes.
Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
Yeah, and I better call my sister.
Whatta you wanna do?
I get that feeling, yeah.
Half for doing what?
Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this?
What?  Is that what you're calling me about?
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
No, I didn't know that.
We're leaving.
Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn is...
Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
Shit, yeah.  White Boy even got busted for it.  White Boy, tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary that time.
I've seen 'em used on TV.
Not until recently.
You're right.  So why take a chance--
If I could have a little more room.
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
Buddy.  That's his given name?
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.
I believe you would have.  Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went.
Of course I am.
You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
Peter Finch.
Nothing.
Who was it answered the phone?
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
I just thought maybe you and me could--
I can go to the bar.
I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
I don't think it works if we're somebody else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?
Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
She did, huh.
He killed a police officer.
I'm just going to the bathroom.
I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
Studs.  Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc.  What's going on?
How many?
Any time.
Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late.
The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
It works.  You should try it sometime.
How are you, Richard?
A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open the safe, not your maid.
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
Hejira.
Like what?
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
I'm freezing my ass off.
Studs.  Hey, son, you must be one a them psychic friends.  I was just thinkin' about you.
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
Uh-huh.
Gimme another hint.
Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?
Me?
I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is <i>my</i> job.  You're either in or you're not.  You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine.
Great.  We got one of 'em.
How you know that?
Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
That's Kenneth, my brother.  He's talking on the phone.
He said he stayed here last November.
It's a --
Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
He's still married though, huh?
Then they're not separated, are they?
What're you doing at Glades?
You used to like it.
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
I don't have any idea.
Yeah, as soon as we got back.
I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
Are they dead?
He was that good?
But...they called you Strange?  Because of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red Grange strange?
That's me, Sir.
Sir?
Mai-tai's.  I got this to tell ya, about mai-tai's.
You guys know her?!  I gotta have an intro!  Man, I'd like to --
Good shooting, Rafe!
Yeah.
What facts are those?
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
Six P-40's.
They're coming around for another pass. You got extra weapons and ammo?
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China.  I'm on your wing.
He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
Well...sure.
Hang on.
How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
Thank you, Sir.
I take it back, about the flowers.  We're all gonna die.
Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
You too, Lieutenant.
The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.
But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --
It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you were dead.  And now --
I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me.
So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.
Crank her!
Goodbye, Grandma.
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
Well, besides Charlie, of course.
That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
Just what you underlined.
Aren't we a little old for that?
What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
I know. Put Scott through college.
Pretty strange.
I call this the staccato. 
Refresh my memory.
They'll learn to live with it.
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
I have to talk to you..
I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
It opens, too. Look inside.
What about Janet?
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
Touchy, touchy!
But I'm remembering the future.
He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late.
But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
I'd love to.
Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles.
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
Oh. I forgot.
I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today.  Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health.
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
I don't feel very festive.
What does Charlie think about that?
He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
You have an incredible memory.
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
Gee. I'm sorry to hear that.
You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it fourthirty. I have a rocket club meeting.
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule!
How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
What are you talking about?
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
Sure.
It sucked.
You alright?
I'm going out, Dad!
I'm not hungry.
Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...
Maybe it takes a while...
I don't know but I'm not taking any chances...
Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
In a word, Bob...
Sorry...
Because they deserve to, Walter.
Andy?
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
I said, don't worry about it.
A reaction to AZT...
You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
You're going to the office?!
CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK!
That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.
No sweat, buddy.
If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
I'm seeing him this afternoon.
Dr. Klenstein.  It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away.
Your Honor, I submit there were no complaints until Counselor began knocking on doors, drumming up business. And the dust, which Counselor refers to, has appeared on only three occasions. Each time it has been examined and the results...
Little baby girl.
You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
Let's find you a drink.
Thank you.
It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
I suppose you could say that.
I still am.
No. I didn't.
You don't bring your personal life into a law firm. You're not supposed to <u>have</u> a personal life, really. Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles, eventually. But then, this thing happened at the tennis club...
Yes.
It was good working with you, Andrew. You're welcome.  Hey. Shouldn't you put that thing back on?
Gay movies.
I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
No.
Absolutely.
Objection.
Yes.
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did <u>not</u> know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...
Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's <u>see</u> what we're talking about.
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
Uh.... No. Not really.
It satisfied me.
Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now.
Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job.
What kind of people?
Get a life.
Duh...
Probably since she was born.
Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
How did you do that?
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
Charles...
Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"
... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy.  What, Bob?
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out.  Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.
Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
<u>What</u>?
Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
Look deeper.
I got the quick-and-ugly version.
Had it with deals.
Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.
Think about what?
One or two.
Let's drop back an' boot up.
Riddick? How close?
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.
No, you see, I <u>promised</u> them...I have to...I have to go and....
Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.
Probably right.
So I noticed. Never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship.
Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.
25 kilos each, huh?
Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
Anything <u>else</u> we should know about you, Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play games with our lives when --
What the hell's it matter?
79 kilos.
We're just burnin' light here.
Riddick. <u>Riddick</u>.
-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
One of the Christian habits we <u>didn't</u> adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait.
"Some prophet guy." And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God.
Quiet, please. Everyone.
Rain.
Which half?
Get the girl back under. Keep going.
KEEP GOING OR I WILL!
I'm born-again.
Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.
If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?
Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?
Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.
And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?
I don't. And I'm not going to try.
It's probably wrong --
Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
Yo!
Yo!
But how long is a day?
Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
Huh?
What signal?
We're here to stay.
We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
Taylor.	I'm telling you --
Let's take a look.
In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
Read it yourself.
Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
Okay.Up to the cave.
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.
Listen, listen -- I can speak --
Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry.
KILL YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!!
How the hell did he get away?
YOU - you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one!!!!!
Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
Fuck this shit! I ain't dyin' in no white man's war! Ise didi-ing this motherfuckah!
Okay, here it is - one, we got gooks in the fuckin' perimeter.
Yeah. How 'bout you?
Dawn...
I volunteered.
Well sometimes a man jes don' wanna go back. How you gonna talk to civilians man? People back in the world just don't give a shit, y'know what I mean, to them you're a fuckin' animal is all -
They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.
Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
You know what I'm talking about!
Merle? Jesus!... Patty?
Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.
So he got a reduced and come over here. Nam's his freedom man, Nam's his pussy. Three years he been here.
If you're gonna do it man, 'least do it right.
That's what he is... Baaaa!
Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
Maybe you're going to have to like me.
How long would that take?
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
As I said before...
No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
He got in here how?
I'd rather wait until it does matter.
That's putting it mildly.
Just who are you, anyway?
I'm different. I like it fine.
Is this the best you can do?
I didn't notice him.
Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
No percentage in that.
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
Do you have to leave the note?
That, and the fun of it.
Including Killaine.
So that I will never be found.
And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
Yes.  You.  You're not really a murderer yet.
Yes.
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
Is it a crime?
I know that.
There's an empty taxi across the street.  If you're so anxious, take it.  He'll know the way to the police headquarters.
This way.
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
You mentioned information.
I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.
Hardly. Who's the girl?
She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.
Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something, I know less than I did before.  Well, I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.
Could we discuss that some other time?
That must hurt.
Would that make me a heel?
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
Where would she go, anyway.  Don't tell me you haven't got her covered.
Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
Did I do something wrong?
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies.
I don't think you locked your door.
Sardonic, if you will my dear. Bust nasty. You lied about the gun.
He saw my face too.
They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
Thank you. It is rather late... and I'm not young anymore. Good night.
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police. 
Correct, Inspector. A woman's gun. U.S. 125 caliber ammunition in it. It was on a table in there.
I've always looked forward to it. All right, let's get him out of here and tidy up.
Do I know who lives down there?
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
Not quiet yet.
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.
Two.
Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
Who's the girl?
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
You ought to know why.
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
I have no intension of being nasty, Mr. Mitchell.
What a shame.
It's fine, thank you.
To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
I think you'll do very well.
Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
Very good.
But what we need is national coverage.  It's difficult with this Falklands madness going on. Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back?
Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
Don't tell me you've actually read it, Jeremy.
Of course.
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
Thank you.
Freshman and sophomores...
I think it went on rather too long.
I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.
I haven't really thought about it.
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
To the Fleet.
Come on.  Hand over.
Mmm...
I'm not sure.
Are you up to something?
You're a piece of shit
Why not sit down and wait?
What about the Cromwells?
Take a look at these.
No.
We might be able to dig out a couple of Suez survivors for you.
Tom . .. bed!  Go on.
De nada.
Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed.
Once.
Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
You gotta earn trust.
After you, Alfonse.  I insist!
Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there.
See!  That's what I like about you, man!  You're just sharp as a razor blade.
But you're not alone.
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
Caught my first tube this morning.
Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
The fucking punks are surfers.
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.
It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
Thanks, buddy.
Did he rob it?
Yeah, or cashing a check.
Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
They took a left at the next light!
Nothing.
Figured you did.
Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
Catch of the day.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
What are you talking about?
Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
What about the rest of Hopper's men?
Like the old days, Dillon.
They're getting better equipped every day.
Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
We take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. No prisoners, Dillon.
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
Now what, Dutch. You going to send your mystery guest an invitation?
You know you can't win this one.
The best friend I ever had.
There's no sign of it.
No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
But I do know.  I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will...  Ah, the escargot.
I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch.
You what?
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
How?
This time I imagine you would, yes.  Hmm...  With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?
Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
If you can figure it out, be my guest.
What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian.
Diet coke.
Do you plan everything?
Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance.
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
Just a romantic, that's you.
I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
All right, two thousand.
Done.
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
... all right.  I'll meet you in the lobby.  But only cause you're paying me to.
Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
Dinner can wait.
He died a long time ago.
I think it's exciting.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing.
I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...
What happened to him?
It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
Vivian...
Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.
You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides...  You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?
Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth.
We just did.
Goodbye, Bill.
Let him answer.
And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole!
Kit!  Where've you been?
I'm getting dressed now.  I'll be over.  Bye.
Baby!  Rodeo Drive.
Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
Do I!?  Momma!
And leave all this?  Not in a million.
Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
Vivian.
Of course.  Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.
But I always eat like this.
Hmmm... I vonder vich. 
What if they serve soup?
But what if they serve soup?
Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
I'm just looking, thanks.
Yes.  Something... conservative.
Excuse me?
Then I'm here till I die?
So it's to be torture.
You survived the Fire Swamp. You must be very brave...  ... but nobody withstands The Machine. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           69.
Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
You're a silly girl.
Should I be?
I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?
As you wish.
Of course you will.
I will never doubt again.
Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
What? -- go on --
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
Gently.
Did you say, "I do"?
Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
I believe you -- So what happens now?
You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
Anybody want a peanut?
I thought I was going faster.
Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way?
It's you.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.
Right, right, sorry.
What?
Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right.  The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.
Yeah. It's really good.
-- well, when does it get good?
I don't be-leeve this.
-- murdered by pirates is good --
Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.  So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor.
My spy network has heard no such news.
The gate has but one key, and I carry that.
Of course.
Yes.
Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.
-- offer me money --
-- offer me everything I ask for --
Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
That does put a damper on our relationship.
Again. Thank you.
You are ready, then?
Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
Then why are you smiling?
No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
Whoever he is, he's too late --  -- see?  The Cliffs of Insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.
I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
Congratulations.
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
What you were saying.  Keep talking.
You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
Exactly.  And how long did it run?
Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
Aaaaaaaaaa!
They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
Coney Island??
I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
Right.
I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!
Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band.  I don't care how big the deal is.
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.
Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous. You couldn't have picked a better color.  It brings out your eyes. Let's face it, Roger, that dress is you.
What is it?
Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.
Really, I never dreamed ...
That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. 
All right.  Finish the job.  Let's get outta here.
No.  We go. 
You can count on me-o, you dirty young man.
Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
Oh, the best one.
And we'll finish playing the Contessa and Rudolfo.
Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't want to miss one minute of it.
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
OH.  "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, Yankee Doodle is my ... " Listen, this is not place to talk.  Come! 
I mean in show business.
Oh, sing.  Sing!
No good, baby, no good.  You heard my orders.  Nobody retreats. Attack!  Attack!
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
Of which morning?
How do you know she didn't make a call?
You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
How did she pay you?
If she paid you well?
Who are you, friend?
Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I'm just...
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache?
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
And the police haven't been able to...
Like what?
What difference does that...
May I talk to you?
Don't you know?
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
A good reason, I suppose.
Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
You've led a charmed life.
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
Just wait here?
Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...
Well?
I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
What makes you sound so certain?
Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
Sam!
Sam. This is the last time.
This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
I have to go, Sam.
You make respectability sound... disrespectful.
Don't miss your plane.
It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
Where are you going? I don't mean to pry...
What are you running away from?
Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
Good night.
Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
No. An old woman, his mother.  That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and...
It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
Better sign in first, hasn't we?
Yes.
Do what?
Leave me alone!
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.  What'd he exactly say when he called you?
Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.
Did I?
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
Hm--pressure-- To Buckley. That's all right. We'll talk later.
Maybe you're right.
He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
That's it. You get it quick.
You're not as quick as I thought. I figgered out that rats breed faster than cats-- cat skins make good fur-- The cats eat rats. Rats eat raw meat. That is, they eat the carcasses of the cats. So --the cats eat the rats--the rats eat the cats. And I get the skins--simple ain't it?
It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
He isn't here.
The wound is bleeding!
Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
It's Igor at the Wax Museum! You'll find your judge embalmed in wax! He's a statue of Voltaire, with all the other corpses! The whole place is a morgue -- do you hear? -- a morgue! 
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
Yeah, but they leave you plenty.
So that's the way it is?
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure.
And I have no desire to hurt you. You will always be beautiful. Think, my child, in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now.
Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You birds are going to get yours. And anyhow, I found this dump.
What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
You give me a pain!
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
No kiddin'. What's your idea?
We'll grant that.
Almost certain.
No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
What does that prove?
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
Ain't that something. The mad monk of Manhattan. Here goes nothing.  Listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion.
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
Cry-baby?
My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
She laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... She said she wanted to be friends.
Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...
What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
All right, brother. Then you can go to some nice warm place, and I don't mean California.
No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it. 
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
Heaven knows. A lot.
Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
And you think I will permit this, my friend?
And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
I wonder if I could have her pose for me.
He can't hear you.
Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
Excuse me???
Yes....
Is Rose here?
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
Nobody.
He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose.
I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
Am I hurting you?
I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.
He did?
What are you going to do, Rose?
They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
What was your mother like?
Well, yeah.
No. Why should Rose be in my room?
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
I do wish you'd speak to Brother. It's true he's been looking at those horrible little books again.
She's watching the car again?
At least.
They're discussing it.
What are they doing?
Is that all?
Then why does she act so dumb?
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
What?
And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
She will succeed.
Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe.
You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.
They follow her because she's a --  -- no, I won't say that.
Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?
She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
I am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition. I wash my hands or the whole thing.
Over... my... dead... body!
All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
Oh, I don't know, I... I...
Don't make me... me... me... get up!
Got yourself up?
Well, it has buttons.
My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.
That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
All right, damn it. We've seen you with your clothes off around here, stand up and pull up your dress and let's take a look!
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says I would too if I was grown-up. Is it true, Mother -- would I sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says?
What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?
Illusions, Madam?
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it.
Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
It'll get better now.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
Okay, man, okay.  I'm with you.  I... I heard how the shit's arriving...  It's coming in a Lincoln.
Now you know what to watch for...
I don't know.  Fuck off!
If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back?
Really?  Is that a fact... ?
Again.
I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
Alright!  Alright... put me down...
I need the "when" and the "where."
Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this.  Leave off.  Here's your paper.
That wasn't my fault.
What do you want me to do about it?
I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.
Relax.
Hands off the suit, monkey-boy. Close your eyes if you're scared.
Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
I'm back here, aren't I?  So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
I'm waiting till the time's right.
No.
There probably is.
Where have you been?
Well, sir...
I insist.  What will it be?  Boston Tea Party Clam Chowder, or maybe the Chicken Red, White and Cordon Bleu? No...  There's a special on the menu, today only...  ... <U>roasted</U> <U>pig</U>.
Wave that flag, hero.  Keep dreaming those dreams.
What are you, communist?  At least numb-nuts here has the courtesy to pretend he likes them.
All I'm saying is, your little Bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper couldn't get out.
Absolutely.
Don't crowd him.
Let's hope.
Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
I worked my ass off for my badge, Kittle,  It's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there.
Out here.  On your knees.
Your wish is my command.
Beholden to none.
That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
They're... around.
Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
Leia! Leia's my sister.
I can't see.
Where am I?
Who are you?
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
Hi, Han... Chewie.
Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
Han, don't. It'll be all right.
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
It'll work. It'll work.
It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
Here's the terminal.
All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.
Lando!
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
You, too.
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
Red Leader standing by.
Oh, no.
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
I know, father.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
Certainly not!
Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.
I told you, my car broke down.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
It's just a..a party Janet.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
You know this earth - this person.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
From Transexual Transylvania.
So come up to the Lab.
Now I
Oh my, my,
Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Oh.
...Fine.
Ohh!
My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
Do you have a phone?
I think he might be worried.
No, I don't belong here.
I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.
Don't tease me.
They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag?
I gotta go out for a while.
What're we going to do?
Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
Paulie!
Don't talk like that to him!
I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
You're hurtin', man!
Apollo, I'm sure there's a way to salvage this.
Don't like yours neither.
Move your shoulders down.
No wine.
No dollar.
Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent ya face!
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight. Kinda do it like a hobby. See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right?
This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes.
Charge it.
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.
You think I don't hear things?
He's always in a bad mood.  Count ya blessin's. Ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work --
...Thanks.
Rocky.
I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available.
Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.
What'd you say?
Hey --
I like yella teeth.
Yeah.
...Tomato?
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
Yeah --
Ya puttin' me on?
Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here? Here, sit down.
Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that.
...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
Yo, can I have my locker back?
Listen, I'm with you -- But ya gotta talk to Mickey -- I put ya stuff in the bag over there.
Bullmastiff.
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
Let's get outta this stink.
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
Maybe ya better forget it.
Sure I like her.
She got gaps. I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.
...It's cold outside, Paulie.
What can I do about it?
What break? Huh? What break! Who am I to give breaks! I'm a fighter, you haul meat. You do what you do an' I do what I do best -- that's it -- that's life, man!
Apollo's a great fighter.
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can.
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
They?
Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  But we'll let Santino handle that.
What am I, Earl?
No...
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
That's because I don't have a doorbell.
He's right here in the...
Doom.
So what do you want me to do?
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
No, I don't.
Take it easy.
Aah!
I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.
I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
Me.
What is this, Twenty Questions?
Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...
Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
But new struck cuz.
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter now. We must entreat the time alone.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
I pray thee, chde me not; whom I love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow; the other did not so.
O, mighty is the powerful grace that lies in plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities: for nought so vile that the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give, nor aught so good, but strain'd from that fair use revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: virtue itself turns vice, being misaplied; and vice sometimes by action dignified. Within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power: for this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. Two such empossed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs, grace and rude will; and where the worser is predominant, full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
Romeo, come forth.
What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
Madam, I am here. What is your will?
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
By and by, I come: -- To cease thy strief, and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send.
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
Well what shall I swear by?
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.
I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth!
And then...
Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
That's him.
You lose them!
Not yet...
Check this out.  Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...
Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.
But would you stake your life, that's the question...
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
Ready when you are...
Don't do it, Sam!
He'll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though me and kill this fucker.
You first, Edvard.
Bad company...
In here...
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
It's done.
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
Because if there's more than one party involved, if we really are working for different people, then perhaps some of us are on different sides.  Your orders might be different from mine.
I hadn't thought about it.  Understand me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it.
Really?
Not exactly.
No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the mind I can control.  Alright, let's do it.
I didn't expect that he would.
Gets the job done.
My way is better.
Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
Eat shit and die slowly...
I know cops -- and you're no cop.
No thanks.
I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.
Jujitsu.
I wanted to see who you were.
You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened.  This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody...  Including you...
I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.
I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
You don't have to do this.
The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them.
Because I owe you.  Look at that...
You think?
Why are you driving?  You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads.  Why are you driving?
I think not.
You better get some sleep, alright?
Just to keep me company, Sam -- I hate smoking alone.  How about you?  I thought all you IRA types smoked.
Seamus Reilly.
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
I'm alright.  And you?
Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about.  I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
I might know where you could get a copy.
Looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here --  one of them's still alive.
Dwayne listen to me -
I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.
Seven thousand...
At the expense of six people.
He saw everything!
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
What are you thinking?
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
There it is...now what about the others?
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
He killed her...he killed her...
It's NOT too late!
I can't.  I can't go on.  I can't keep lying...killing.  That's not me.  That's not US.
Why don't you get to the point.
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
We're going to wait.  All of us, until everything dies down.
Two thousand...
No.  It's not.
Hello.
Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report.
Are you sure you're OK?
I don't know.  My friends...
A week ago, at most.
How about you give us what you have and leave.
Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
This just might be our ticket!
We appreciate that.
Hi.
No, I can't say that I have.
Take it or leave it.
A surprise huh?  Well I don't like any surprises, especially if I'm forking over the loot for them!
I didn't say that.  You did.
And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
What?
Well you're not getting, either.
Stop!  Stop!  I don't need the money.  You can have it all.
Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.
Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.
And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
Anything in it?
So someone did get away.
Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station.  How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants a hundred dollars?
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.
No.
This won't take long.
I am a tourist.
How you doin'?
Who died?
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
Good at what?
This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me...  This is about more than all that, isn't it?  This is about your Daddy's last case, right?
What?
You said --
Why LA?
Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
The same place you find all RichWhiteMen.  Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.
What?
Take it!
We can help you.  I'm a detective in Hong Kong.
What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.
I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
Mind your own business.
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
No mu-shu.
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
Follow me my Asian brother.
It's worth it to me.
It's okay, I got lots more.
No.  But I'll help you.
Baby Duck?
Are you okay, Lee?
Thank you.
I know, Master, but...
That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation.
They asked for the best street man I had.
You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
No.
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
We are both full of shit.
Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.
I know a shortcut.
You don't know what a shortcut is?
What plate?
Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
Who does not know War?  War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh.  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing. Good-God, you all.
Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type.
Oh yes.
You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.
Where'd you get it?
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way back to China.  Now, get out. Before I file obstruction of justice charges against you.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying.
Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town.  You have twenty-nine minutes left.
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
I was trying to find the right time.
Ike just came by to check out the team.
So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.
Let me take you back inside, okay?
You bet ya, Coach.
How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
Maintain eye contact.
What did he ask?
Good one!  Thanks.
God bless you, Maggie.
Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
It's hurting.
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
I already made an appointment for later today.
No.  No, you didn't.
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
I don't think that's why she ran.
No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.
No, she's talking about your hair.
Bye, Betty.  Thanks.
Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.
Ah, beautiful.  I just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that.
Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.
You'll answer my questions?
Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
Twice...
We think so.
A pre-wedding luau?
I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
Six-fifty.
Can you fix it?
Yes.
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
I'd rather not.
I love you, too.
And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics.  Traitor!
"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
Why?
No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
Lighten up, what?
I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
Good boy, Port Hole.
Houseboats don't go anywhere.
-- who's married to --
-- who is the most competitive woman in the world --
I love you.
What is it?
Does it have wheat in it?
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
What?
It's just like my grandmother's china.
It was my mother's.
Walter, there's something I have to tell you --
So what happened?
At the top of the Empire State Building --
Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
Yes.  Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.
What?
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
Thank you.  I love you.
M.F.E.O.?
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
It doesn't mean anything.  It was written before I went out there.  Before the ho.
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
Okay.
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
I know. 
I want my money.
That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm going back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high- five?
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
Any time.
You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
Magic.
It's me?
The cabinets have to be redone --
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.
I don't think I could really describe it.
You want me to talk to him?
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
What's tira misu?
You think so?
I don't know.  Do I?
It's never happening again. Right?
My feelings exactly.
It plays in 50 states.
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
I know.
I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut. 
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
No.
It's a short word.
Who is Annie?
This is the one I like.
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
Shut up.
This conversation is finished.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
No.
Sure.
Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
What about it?
Microwave.  Five minutes.
Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later.  It's so beautiful here.
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
You did?
He's good at it.
I read the same article...
Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
No thanks.
It never ends.
Yeah.
An American.
No, Estellita.
All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
He'll have it good. Some day.
Over my dead body.
Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.
No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.
You mean Delaware?
You've got to help around the house!
You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
What attitude?
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ... 
Nothing, I'm trying to remember...
Now that's down-right insulting.
Then leave.
Why not?
You get off on abuse or something?
What happened to your eye?
Like you?
Please open the door, Danny.
Find a new job.
It's Tom.
I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
Twelve
Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.
A quarter of a million, Jimmy.
10%.  That's ...
The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Hey, check it out...
I can't tell you.
Make me an offer.
Pull your pants down.
Big Bill.
Please .. I don't know what you're ...
No one. It was just a test. I need to be sure of who I'm dealing with from time-to-time.
Just some buddies.
Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat.
Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.
Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.
Whata you mean?  He told me -
Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ...  You're in the bathroom.  You've been shot in the shoulder ...
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
To who?
And what does this have to do with me?
What?!
There's no motels around here.
That is so unfair.
Don't we always take good care of you?
Maybe he isn't showing.
Where are your men now?
So they travel around from place to place and preach?
Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
Like hell, you did.
Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
Gives Wade the second shot.
Good, now get your goddamned gear.
Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him.
It was nothing.
I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
Plenty.
Same place we are.
You don't count.
Sure, you got one?
I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
Okay, Wade.  Translators?
PUSH!
Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
Vecchio.
I think you're right, Keith.
We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies.  Miller Dream on, private.
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.
Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here.
See to it.
HERE THEY COME!
More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation.  They know that they are dead men.  They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die.
No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.
We all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.
What are we likely to run into?
So you refuse to answer my questions?
For going to school?
Good for her.
Excellent.
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
You're sure?
Good thing there's not a red line on you, J-man. YEAH!
Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
What's a scam?
C'mon Lloyd.
I'm sorry.  It's just you're a really nice guy, and we don't want to see you get hurt.
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
What?  I'm sorry, talk.
I dream about it.
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.
Dad, I'm sorry.
You're going.
Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
Swear to god.
Yes, I...
You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
Hi.  You called me?
Yeah?
Thank you very much.
No.
Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
They knew of you.  Now they know you.
Twisted?
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
Yeah?
Really?  Um... I... well... you're really turning me around here,
Okay, bye, I will.
I'm doing alright.
Am I wrecking my car?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes.  Are you shaking?
You're shaking.
Then why are you shaking?
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
No, we don't have to say it.
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
How can I look at you and say this?
What's wrong?
Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
We decided...
Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.
You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
Alright, high level air safety tips.  If anything happens, it'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight, right?
He's back.  Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?
Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
Hello.  May I please speak with Diane please?
Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall.
Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.
Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Fine Lloyd.
How do you pay for one of those?
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride.  You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.
She's very successful.
Just knowing a person like that exists, knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'I still can't help loving you'. That's gotta be a good thing, right?  That's gotta be a good thing.
Your car?
What?
A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
A charade?  How could it be a charade?
Good.
They're not gone, they're here.
The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah.
Wine?
Pistols?
No, look.  It's the others.  They're the ones causing these delays.
The contracts?  That's the easy part. Finding the money to buy the company, that's hard.
They should be.
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
Yes.
Christmas presents.
Are you losing money?
Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
Stern.
No?
37 usages of Himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless.
No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
That doesn't work, sir.
They've broken their pattern.
What is it?
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
You have a right to be angry.
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
And much richer as a result.
No, I don't.
Where do you think he got it? Mental illness is heriditary. Who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? He was a smart kid but children need parental guidance.
Finish what my son started.
Enter Cotton Weary.
"And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."
Sid, you don't have to.
The forbidden subject.
Let us decide that.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
The way I see it. Well be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
Hope youre ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
Tails.
Tuitions expensive.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
I know that.
Not good.
Let's find out.
Dewey, there's no such place.
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
Don't do this.
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.
Her old boyfriend?
Thanks, Joel.
Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.
But...
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
But...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
He's after me.
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
Do I?
But your voice sounds so familiar.
Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
Good bye Ben.
Very good. You follow directions well. Now for the final part of the game. Put down the bat and approach the sign, slowly.
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.
Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.
Yeah. A real tragedy.
What does this have to do with Sid?
What Rielly?
And what made you think it was Sidney?
Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
Always.
Fuck!
Nevermind, what'd you two find?
Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
What the hell are you doing?
Gale Weathers would find a way. 
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Good twist.
They're the ones who approved it.
Who's this.
Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
I'm hanging up right now.
SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
Who is this?
You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
Are you sure?
Oh...
And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid.
Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
Where the fuck did she go?
You sleep in THAT?
Oh it did?
I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
Hey, hey, it's just me.
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
Or even a good porno.
You don't still think it was me?
Fuck you.
Are you alone in the house?
Wait, wait, don't hang up.
What's that noise?
You have to have a favorite.
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
Don't...
To talk.
More of a game, really.
TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.
Sure...
No...
Come on, yes you do.
It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
No, not yet.
I don't think you're so bad.
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
Hold up a sec...
Yeah.
Afraid not.
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
We haven't located her Dad yet.
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
The phone's dead.
You want to go live?
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
And why is that?
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
So who are you?
Uh-huh.
...out at the airport...
Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that.
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
He came to make up.
Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
The official term is "psychotic".
I'll be there by seven. I promise
He was there, Tatum.
I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.
Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.
During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on.
Deal.
Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.
Tits -- see.
Give it to me.
I'm in.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
Turn around.  Hands on your head!
NO!
Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
Spit it out.
Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.
And, why is that?
Sit back.
What the fuck is going on?
Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
What?
Is there any blood in it?
Okay... sure...  It's just that, with my old partner, you know...
Have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink?  Near the food?
Detective Mills here.  Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back...  What?  Why?
Tonight.
It's got to be.
We're screwed.  He's fucking with us.
And you don't?
Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
I've seen the same.  I'm not the country hick you seem to think I am.
Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
Oh, it's alright.
It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can't make that mistake.
It's be best if you got to the point, cause I'm about ready to punch you in the face.
What?  Assessing fines?
Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Think it through.  If we leave a hole like this, we'll never prosecute.  He'll walk.  We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door.
We had him.
You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
You do your job...
Big surprise.
When do we get to question him?
I can't let you do this...
Don't do this... please...
I guess I won't be showing it to him then.
If you can, please call me.  Please.  I have to go now... goodnight.
Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
I want to have children.  It's just...
Crime of passion.
That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
What, Ben?
Dunno...Seems so.
Yes sir...
You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
JOINT action?
These are my people...  Unnt-meah! Go! Go! <U>Please</U>!
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...
Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
Leggo...
Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...
YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
What?
How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
I ain't sure...Where's that doll?
Not no more.
It's what I'm countin' on.
Not far from it...
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.
I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...
No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...
You crazy?
Only if I'm dead!
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
You'll never get away from me!
Oh, that was upstairs.  A real antiquity!  I think it's great.
Do you have a better idea?
You?
Yes, daddy.
Making our very own solstice fire.
I just had a really strange experience.
Someone from the village.
You know, it's not always easy for me, either.  But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis.
Come on, at least try one.  It took me two hours to make these.
Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
In the village.  Look what I found.
Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
Hi, darling.
Damn it, look at you!  Don't you see what's happening with you?  We need to get out of here, don't you understand?  Out of this house!
We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
I have a yearning for... smog, cars and many, many people... A real dirty... big city. What do you think?
I wouldn't have made it by myself.
Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired.
You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?
How could I fail to notice that! - I have to go...
Ladies and gentlemen: The "Straub country-residence".
I guess someone lost their key. You did get your tetanus shots, I hope?
The speech is excellent.  "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible.
And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
You have the money?
Twenty pounds on delivery
You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
See you in jail.
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so
That's me.
Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
What piece? Richard Crookback?
Who wrote that?
To my weekly confession.
I did not.
No, it will turn out well.
I don't know, it's a mystery.
Good title.
Do you think?
When the Queen commands it.
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
Your Majesty.
Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
I have lost my gift.
I would have made you immortal.  Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare.
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
I like her.
But the plague
I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
A lowly player.
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
You never spoke so well of him.
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
Orsinogood name
I do not love you, my lord.
Virginia?!
I will do my duty, my lord.
Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?
It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink.
Are you bringing your laundry woman?
What?
I don't have time.
Have you seen him?
You call them if you want.
I don't hear this.
I just thought we should discuss it.
I want to talk now.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Security.
No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me.
What's wrong?
Looking for you? Yes.
They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --
They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
Oh, no, no, no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best.
I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
Well, then?
Yes.
Yes.
Alex.
What I am.
Did what?
Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?
Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
I want my money back. Excuse me.
It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
You were magnificent.
Are you all right?
Then let's spend some money.
He's right. You'd feel much better about it.
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing --
He can't stay up there.
Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
What are you doing here?
Forget it -- he'll come down.
No.
Oh, shut up, Alex.
I see.
You were going to say something.
You mean I can have the room?
What about?
did you hear anything before he cries?
Someone lost the key.
You're sure of that.
That wasn't a question.
OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
No.
Two hundred pounds?
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet.
With a face like this?
Not any real sneering as such, no.
I'm not sure --
Yes, sir.
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
What happened to that guy?
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
It's a breeze.
No.
It's an improvement.
I'm a doctor.
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Is it real?
Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
Chicken salad, Devra!
Yeah, baby, how's it going?
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
That you were just indulging me.
Lester, don't you think that uhh --
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
That's okay too.
No.
I gotta talk to you.
Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been cutting too much hair lately. I'm losing all my concepts...
I hope she's all right.
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.
I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times.
I guess so.
No thanks.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
Great.
Great.
Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
You going to tell him?
Okay.
Whew.
It's hot in here.
Why not?
And what?
I just have to do one little thing.
You did, didn't you?
You did, I know you did.
Yeah, baby...
You don't do that anymore, do you?
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --
Sweetheart, you're drunk.
Jackie, can we --
You were great.
I am you, you little bastard.
-- well, if you feel like playing, go play...
Not me, pal.
-- well you better go after her.
That's it, then I'm leaving.
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
What?
What for?
She's heavy.  See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk. I gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense.
Wanda...
She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
-- A brillo pad, I don't care, anything.
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
What's gonna happen?
George, I don't --
How?
Of course I like children.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
I'll call you.
Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
Commercials.
-- she's a very compulsive girl.
I'm very tired, George.
Let go of me.
Oh, Christ.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...
I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
Jesus.
What did you say?
No?
Well, yeah.
I'm better than the guy I work for.
After a while that hurts... doesn't it?
They're not?
Okay.
Oh, hey...
I don't know what to...
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
Now wait a minute...
Oh Jesus Christ.
I'm not anti-Establishment.
Then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do.
No thanks.
I know.
No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
What?
I'll call you back.
Okay, okay...
Yeah.
Sid. You must be a very important executive.
Is that right?
That's not very logical, Lester.
Look... you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share.
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Jesus, she's my best friend.
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
So what's your point?
Don't be silly.
-- No. No really.
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
But you have problems?
Jackie --
Well, that's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad.
Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.
Is he an enemy?
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
Well you should have eaten your breakfast.
Okay.
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
Do they know he tell you things?
Try to think what it was.
What about Room 237?
All right.
Okay...oh!
Yeah.
Danny, come here!
Do I have to?
Thank you.
Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
Well how can I repay you?
That's right, sir.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
He is, Mr. Torrance.
Grady... oh.
Sure.
Oh, that's just great.  How do you folks like our hotel so far?
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
Thank you for saying so.
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
Hi, hon.  How's it going?
Ah, come on hon.  Don't be so grouchy.
I can't really remember.
I'm not going to hurt you.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Give me the bat.
Stop swinging the bat.
Oh, well - come on in Jack.
Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
Oh...
Oh!
Oh, I'll say.
How do you do?
Fine.
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
What if it's some kind of monster?
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
Do I need one?
I don't get you.
Sure.
You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
You want to know what I think?
Marty, do you see your suspect?
There! You see!
And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy?
Well... because it's in the Bible. "Thou shalt not..."  Thou shalt not.
Good evening, Vincent.
I feel sorry for you, Vincent.  And I forgive you.
Joey -- do it.
I love my heddles.  Show me again.
Mary Clarence, could you?  Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but...  Could you help us?
Chops?
Am I?
So use it.  When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration.  Most music is.  So don't hold back.  Let all that joy go right into your voice.  Make me happy.  Let me hear it.  Perk out.  Perk down.
Pay attention...
Were you wicked?
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
You know that song?
I hear you.  How many days a week do you rehearse?
Wet behind the ears.
Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
Again!
An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.
Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
Experience!  Right?
Honey.
Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything.  I mean, nothing really happened.  We just... took a walk.
We're nuns!
A thank-you?  For what?  You're the one we should be thanking.
Oh no.  We'll always be together.
Again?
It's true!
I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?
You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
What?
What's a concubine?
Silence?  No talking?  All day?
A what?
Yes.  Until breakfast.
From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. 
You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  Such as your own, for example.  How do you feel about physical labor?
A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
And I am refusing.  As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.
What do you mean?
You have a phone call.
Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.
Saving you.  Move!
I'm a Christian.
Information, baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
He didn't do you a favor.
Then-you run.
You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
Get a stenographer.
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity.
Me too.
What?
I think they'd understand.
You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?
You won't even tell us?
You found him -- but we're not open yet.
It didn't happen.
Which one!
Which one?
Where is she?
Forget her!  We got the one we need! Step on it!
Neither did you!
That's what I figured, too.
We can't leave it up to the Feds!
However, we can also pray for other things.
Really, Mary Clarence?  Were you a choirmistress?
That was exciting!
It's better than ice cream.
Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
She wasn't a nun?
Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her.  Pull yourselves together.
And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
And you'll face that danger head-on.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
Find 'em!
This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?
Many have.
Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.  What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death?
How did you hear this?
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
To place it inside its coffin.
What is that?
All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
Does that look like an animal hanging?
Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
Master Hardenbrook...
Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.
The militia?
I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
Up.
It's payment day.  Loan monies are given to Baltus the last day each month.  Almost everyone borrows... for tools or to hire workers.
I have others.  All I need is this.
Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly.
You do not know all that has happened.  You cannot understand.
I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
Small talk.
There is no such thing as magic.
I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
What did you say?
And, what did he say?
What did he say, Katrina?
What would you have me believe?
Yes, actually.
Let her go!
I can show exactly.
What did you say?
Yes.  Here...
Doctor, he is awake.
May I see my mother?
No.
Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
Now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin' but a army cot and a toilet back there.
Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.
I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime.
He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?
Give me the big'uns.
What you got in there, warshing?
Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?
Don't say nothin' about that boy.
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.
He does make some funny noises.
Don't tell me what to do.
What do you want, hun?
Would y'all like that?
No sir.
That ain't none of your damn bidness. Besides that's the way friends do one another. Fuck it, I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find my guitar, I think it's out there in the garage with that loony tune.
I hate you!
What exactly do you mean by that? I don't understand.
If y'all don't shut up I'm gonna go out of my mind. And plus you're liable to bust a spring in Karl's head. He's already off balance.
I thought I told you to keep out!
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.
Childers.
Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
I don't want to worry your mama with company.
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
Why did he do that, reckon.
Two people.
I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.
All right then.
If you want me to.
I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
Pull on your works. Your privates.
You ort not to pull on yourself that away.
I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with.
I heared it cryin' a little through that box.
Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.
I reckon.
Is that right?
No sir.
That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
You know I would. Whatever you want.
Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.
Did Karl go to bed?
We've had a real hard life, too, Mama.
I reckon.
You better go get 'em.
I want to come back and stay here.
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
I didn't aim to.
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
I could shore use some. Thank ye.
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
So, you're really going to stay here?
Oh. How about before that?
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
That's very sweet of you Vaughan. We care about you, too. Don't we y'all?
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
No, we have to get this story.
I knew he slept in a toolshed.
That's really strange. What does it mean?
You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
It's my birthday.
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
I confess.
Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
What's that, Sol?
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?
I wouldn't think of it.  See you around, fellas.
Yeah, I did.
It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
Fuck you, kid.
Nothing much. He said his socks and underpants were dirty, and would we mind driving up with his things.  Fucking kids, huh? They take you for granted every time.
Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy? 
Okay.  So this is the story of how it happened.  Okay.  It was the summer of 'seventy-six, back when I first started working for Vinnie. The summer of the bicentennial.  A kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store. He's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt. It was crowded around the counter just then, so I didn't see him at first....
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.
Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?
Yeah, like what?
Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
Bully for you.
Five thousand bucks.
Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy fella?
Sure thing. See you later.
Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
What difference does it make?
When I tell you it's open. It's open when I tell you it's open!
Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
I think I'll take them. 
The refrigerator?
Thanks for the tip.
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
You mean Rashid?
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!
You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
Just passing through.
I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
I just tell it like it is, mister.  If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.
An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
Say hi to Paul.
Baby? And what baby is that?
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
In Manhattan?
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
Nice drawing. Did you do that?
Drawing's a good thing.
It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it?
Take good care of yourself, okay?
Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
His only copy?
Is it yours?
Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
It's all right. I really do know them.
Now ask him who his mother was.
If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 
Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks...
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work.  So how would he signal for help?
All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
Well, what if?
Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.
Up in the air?  Was <u>that</u> your reaction?
Well, it seems to me...
Those aren't the facts that matter.
Oh, in a heartbeat.
I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun- butt.  A right-handed fella, to be precise.
Twelve.
Like you couldn't believe.
Oh, yeh.  He said someday he would get his land back.
He said he didn't want that life no more.  He'd been saving to buy a farm.  He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place.
Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the <u>truth</u>.
I have told the truth.
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
Shorthard the radio transmis- sions, write 'em up, file 'em in a cabinet.  Nobody ever looks. Just take up space.
Have a look.  At nothing.
No, you don't.
To my father.  Everything counts.
Because the second lantern, the one on the mast.  Was never found.  So we have to ask...
Still lashed to the mast.
Maybe...?
I'll take two.  One for later.
Sure.  Blood gets all <u>over</u> your hand, Sheriff, ask any fisherman.
I should show them an American?
That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said.
Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
As I testified.  It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration.  I believe I said that.
The same.
Sure, anything's poss...
He had no reason to.
Yes.  And that one, too.
I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.
All right, girls - from the top again.
Thank you ever so.
It's entirely mutual.
Manhattans?  This time of night?
Like I was telling you - Little Bonaparte is getting soft.  He doesn't have it here any more.  Used to be like a rock.  Too bad.  I think it's time for him to retire.
Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
Hey, Joe!
Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
Quiet - I'm thinking.
I thought you weren't talking to me.
Yeah, that's what he means. Good old Nellie!  I ought to wring her neck!
Knock it off, will you?
No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
They got the bull-fiddle.
Not yet.  But if those guys catch us, there'll be blood all over.  Type O.
As far away as possible.
I never did like the name Geraldine.
I'm Josephine.  Sax.
Now you've done it!
Tore off one of my chests.
You better come help me.
You tore it again!
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl -
Fight it.
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?
And what are you trying to do to poor Sugar?  Putting on that millionaire act - and that phony accent -  Nobody talks like that!  I've seen you pull some low tricks on dames - but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest -
Yes, Mr. Fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  Oh - zowie! I'll give her the message. 
Oh, I don't expect it to last.  I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
Daphne got a proposal tonight.
Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.
Shut up and keep packing.
There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar.
We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
First thing we got to do is get out of these clothes.
Stay as long as you'd like.
No, no.
That's ridiculous.
You got some?
When?
We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock. I'm Sweet Sue.
The Florida job?
Me too.  Bye now.
Personally, I'm Type O.
You invest in shows?
You're not sure?
Bull fiddle.
Oh, you don't get off that easy.
Who?
And I can never have children.
Just the two of you?  What about the crew?
We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -
Yes, Joe.
It's not the backs that worry me.
Oh.
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
Have you ever been with a male band?
I'll say.
So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright.
What's in Florida?
Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
Good night, Sugar.
Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
She doesn't need one.  I don't have one either.
Not at all.
Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
No, my flag steward.
Up, up, up.
For your own amusement?
You're society girls?
You know, it's amazing we never ran into each other before.  I'm sure I would have remembered anybody as attractive as you.
I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
It's been delightful meeting you both.
They repealed Prohibition?
They shrink when they're marinated.
Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
Have I?  I'm trying all the time.
What happened?
Thanks just the same.
If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
Look, it's terribly sweet of you to want to help out - but it's no use.  I think the light switch is over there -  - and that's the radio.  It's like taking somebody to a concert when he's tone deaf.
Did you have a nice time?
You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela - and I just got a cable from Dad - the board of directors decided on a merger.
But you have.  You've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.
What's what?  Oh, that.  just a little going away present.
I don't know.  All of a sudden, I'm thirsty.
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
I come to the old lady's funeral.
Make is Scotch.  A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.
Go where?
Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
Why?
Goodbye, Charlie.
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
You don't owe me no nothing.
Bacardi 151.
Hey.
Its not me. I swear. Its her. Shes magic.
Oh, dont be that way.
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
Mom, please.
She did?
What?
No.
But, somehow, it was Kats arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
And you do now?
Doesnt look like nothing.
Oh, hello.
Let me guess. Amy presumed Id forget the rings.  I think Im her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. Its no big deal. I promise.
I shagged Amy. Two years ago. Thats why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
Youre funny.
Youre too good for him.
On the nose.  I tell you what, because youre so cute, Ill take care of our incidentals.
Thats right. Imagine facing it alone.
This happened to you?
Shampoo, got it!
Oh, no.
Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
What?!
My sixth-grade science project was entitled, Love Hurts: The Heartbreak of Human Papillomavirus. Trust me, Im careful.
I disappear. Its not about me.
Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
Yup. Thats why you get to keep your money.
Spontaneously combust?
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
You have more than one gynecologist?
Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
Hard.
I say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.
Here, you put your hand under the water and I'll pump for you.
Uh huh...
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
I try...
And you're a tired little boy. I'll make up the cot and you must get some sleep.
It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!
Not now, David, it's time for bed. You have a long trip ahead of you in the morning...
She was dirty and wet...
No, Miss Johnson...
:The night in the woods with his father and SOUNDER. The shouting and laughter after the baseball game --
Yes, sir...
Yes, sir...
Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
Goodnight to you, son...
Come here, son...
Soon -- but it won't be too much huntin' you'll be doin','cordin' to a good little story your mama told me last night -- you'll be goin' away from here, won't you?
You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.
Sausage and hambones!
That's right!
'Bye, son -- I won't be gone long.
You sure can, son...
No mam -- I looked all over.
He'll be all right, Mama. I'll make him all right.
No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
Mama, don't I always do what you say -- every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don't worry.
How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.
He won't go mad -- he's just lookin' for a cooler spot.
I don't know a damn thing, now stop bothering me about it!
I'll walk...
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
Don't belong to you! It's for the little important man, here!
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
Might be...
I brought these walnuts to trade.
Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard? He'll tell you all about it.
I shore could, Miss Rebecca.
The boy is hungry, Rebecca.
What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
Ike, you could make a song outta that!
Don't tell me nothin' 'bout what we owe ol' man Howard! I'll do the owing, and let him worry 'bout the collecting! Come on, David Lee!
Is that a blessing, Reverend?
There are more important matters right now...
Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
Eric!
What? Fuck you guys, I wanna get out of here.
They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
But what are we going to do against this entire army?
Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!
Okay.
I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE!
Yeah... That was my bad, sorry.
You can't do this!! Have you ever HAD Cheesy Poofs? They're a taste sensation with a delightful cheddar crunch.
And she's getting worse...
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
YOU DO?!
No way.
Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
Yes, hon?
Eric, that is not appropriate.
God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle.
Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
Help yourself prickfuck!
Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone licks your ass for-
Oh no, it's that kid.
This will be very dangerous... Are you quite sure?
Doky maping she deeder!!!
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
Mph rm.
You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
Uhh... I don't know.
God? ...Let me tell you something about God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all.
For pooping, silly.
We HAVE to see this movie, dude!
Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!
Totally!
All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people-
Wow!
No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
Me?!
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
Are you sure, Kenny?
Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us. You're a real pal.
What the hell is going on?!
Oh God... What have I done...
No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
What is Terrance and Phillip?
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
You did? Just now?
Terrance! NO!
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself-
Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
You don't care.
Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
This is about freedom of speech, Stan, about censorship.
God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
And the butfor?
Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about.
It can't be.
Of course, of course...
It certainly is.
I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -
Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed.  Thank God for deregulation huh?
We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
Will you transmit the distress signal?
That's me.
Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.
Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.
Don't say that!  It ain't over till it's over!
Will you shut up already?
Like open an airlock by mistake?
Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
Just considering our options... sir.
So we did.
At this point I'm ready for anything.
I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.
Taylor!  Where are you?
I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
Over and out.
Good.  In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.
Congratulations on your...recent award.
He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing?
Send it back if you don't want it.
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
Yes.  You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
Certainly.  Anything I can do to be of service.
Lemme see your ball.
We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
Are you guys bruddas?
gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
Grace Skinner.
I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.
Theo! This is Sheila Kastle, my partner's daughter.
I didn't think so.
I couldn't care less.
I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.
Clam it!
I found dad.
I gotta go. Love ya mom.
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
Why would you help me?
He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
Yippy!
They suspended me.
Where can I find him?
Whips...orange whips.
I'd rather you didn't.
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
We'll get into that later.
So why do you stay?
Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history.  Too late for what?
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
We would have sooner or later.
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
At least I'll die smiling.
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
Suck my dick!
You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.
I'm not here to bowl.
If you wanna do business in this town, there's other people around here got more weight than old Faz.
Back away then.
I said back away.
Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.
Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear it.
What do we use for defense?
What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
Pull it, damn it!
Nothing else.
From what?  What's with all the security?
They didn't tell me anything.
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
Geologists?
It doesn't make any sense.
What team?
ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
Take a look.
What?
I don't know.  That's the point.
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
Nothing, sir.
If the subs aren't here yet, sir --
To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.
Then how can it be chipped?
The what?
He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
Ted, shut up.  Are you packed?  Ready to go?  I want everyone packed.  Now!
To what?
I love secrets.
C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
It never occurred to me.
The library.
Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
Yeah, why?
She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
Where did you get this?
It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?
Beth --
Don't bother me, Norman.
You think?
What do you mean, a part of Harry?
Something for burns.
Valdomet.
Bingo.
Antibiotic.
"... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... "
How long does it last?
You think I'd really drink that?
Don't you?
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
You think I manifested the snakes?
You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.
Don't you know?
I --
Hear what?
Beth --
Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.
Who says it's a he?
Another attack?
I'm fine.
Whatever I can do to help.
To what?
Which one?  Let me get the list out.
Then what, Norman?
What are they?
Her suit's gone.
Wisconsin?
You know what it is, Harry.
Stop what?  What are you -- ?
Help me lift her.
Shut up and catch.
No idea.
Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space.
It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
Please.  It must have flown here --
Thank you.
The others, sir?
Told me what?
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
You mean a picture?
I don't see anything.
This is like nursery school.
You seen my suitcase?
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
Fear is their greatest weapon.
Is that good or bad?
You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.
I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.
You could put it that way.
Could I learn to feel it?
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...
You mean we should go after her!...
You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal.
But there was a lot of firing earlier...
Yes, sir.
I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.
Yes, sir, but I can get him...
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.
What are you saying?
Why?
Move out of the way!
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
With four casualties?!
Who is this?  What's your operating...
You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
YAAAAAAAA !
What about it, Diz ?
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
You got it bad.
Ace of spades.
Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.
Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.
You're upset, that's alright.
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
Why not ?
Carl can wait.
I'll meet you outside.
Good luck at the academy.
I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !
What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
What happened to your eye ?
See you on the bounce !
Up. We gotta be near A Company by now.
Yes, ma'am.
Ibanez...LET'S GO !
Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?
AAAAAAAAAAA !
Good luck. It's not there anymore.
Sir, thank you, sir !
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Aw, don't get mushy.
Hi, mom.
Yeah, that's right.
Been better, buddy.
Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... Gimmee the nuke.
Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !
The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.
What is it, Rico ?
Yes, sir !
V'ger is that which programmed me.
The Creator has not answered.
The information will not be disclosed.
Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
By the Creator.
To learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the Creator on the third planet. That is the programming.
It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
Departure angle.
No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
This served the purpose.
That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!
A tractor beam...
   We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
Viewer, standard ahead.
Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.
Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
Sit down, please.
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
High mag, Mr. Sulu!
No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
The point... 
That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
Engineer, we need Warp speed now!
He'll eat potroast and like it.
You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new.  Better than new.  It has some history.
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
What's it called?
It's in your play.
It's about life.
That's true.  You grow up here?
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
Everyday things...yes.
Surest thing you know.
Yes...
Well, first, you got to change the title...
<u>Yes</u>...
...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
You got a paperclip?
Never saw the point of 'em.
Oh, God...
One moment.
Read the card.
They meet on Main Street.  Her horse has just died.  He's coming from the fire.
Has been wounded by <u>her</u> heat...by her <u>infidelities</u>...
Hi.
Going home.
I'd love to.
Sleep well?
Oh yeah.
Yes...
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
You got to tell em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?
But that's what happened.
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
...I'm sure that people are upset...
What I am <u>saying</u>, is, we have to Look Out For Our Own...Now:  they want to close down Main Street...
After Drama Group.
Sure, but...ten thousand dollars.  Do you know what they...this movie is budgeted at fifty <u>million</u> dol...they're coming up here, offer us a measl...
We had a date.
Where have you been...
Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
Courthouse back in town.
Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
Waterford, Vermont.  Where is it?  <u>That's</u> where it is...
On the coast?  Of <u>course</u> he's on the coast, where's he gonna be, the <u>Hague</u>...
Uh, <u>look</u>....
I <u>know</u> my lines...
I loved it...he...
I'm having dinner with W...
Bourbon and Milk.

You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
I...
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
Well, yeah, I'm fine, I reached over to, the girl had to be home, I don't know, it's a <u>schoolnight</u>, something...
No, wait a, wait a, wait a...we can't put her in the car, she gets it in her head to sue, or rape, or some goddam, she wasn't in...
Well.  What seems to be the...?
The Mayor's outside.
Thank you.
I think he's moved...
I think I should talk to my agent, Marty, you and I should, we should, really not discuss...
She's absolutely r...
I, actually yes.
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
Oh.
She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait!  She came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see...
Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
I don't want to take my shirt off in that con...What are these things that they're asking of me...?  Wha...wha...wha... I try to be good; the only thing I care about is...
I...I...
Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...
What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
He treated me as if I were a child...
Yes.
Her religion bars her from fulfilling her contr...
Well.
You said <u>three</u>...?
<u>Fuck</u> the traffic light.  I'm talking about three percent of the adjusted gross of a Major Motion Picture...
I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
This young woman.
...you know, there's nothing you could say, that could <u>possibly</u> make a difference, so, why don't you just save your breath.
Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
Gut Yuntif.
How about that.
No.  No, but we're planning to.
A witness to what...?
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
I don't know what she's bitching about, she's flashed her tits in the last five movies...she'd bare her breasts to do a <u>voice</u> over.
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
I can't find the writer.
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
Did you, where are we going tonight...?
I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.
I don't drink.
I hurt my finger.
He's got a date, he's got a date, is this guy fantastic...?  Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find...!
You want me to lie.
For what cause?
I left that for you.
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
We're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...
My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.
<u>Pay</u> her.
I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
Sherry, this...
I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.
Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
...the city council...
Yes, I hear it.
I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank of the building.  Said, "What are you doin'?"  He said, "I'm waitin' for the 'leven o'clock crossing..."
Mmm...
It takes all kinds.
Givvem a cigarette...
Mommy's marrying Rache!
Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
Sex.  Of course.
Then why are you putting on mascara?
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
Oh, yeh.
Mom?  What's wrong?
I'll miss you so much.
Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.
But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant!  It starts at seven!
I <u>killed</u> my math quiz, A-minus.
Honey, she won't d...
Annabelle pick up the phone.
That's because your mother is a fine person, finer than I will ever be.  Now, just this once...
But Rache...
There you are!
Cos she loves you.
How could I be?  We learned some magic...
Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.
I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?
I knew where I was all the time.
Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
Sooner than later.  You really need to.
We don't KNOW if you've got it, we haven't SEEN it yet!  Now go back and FINISH!
No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
We're not discussing your age.
It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
I'm worried.
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
Partly.  But partly, you're mad.
You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.
Stop.  You're making me insecure.
Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him?  Boy, kids go wild for that.
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!
Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>.  Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>!
I did it for her.
Not personally.
Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
She was angry at herself.
I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets.  And the note.  From your new boss.
You're taking the kids.  And moving to San Francisco.
Luke.  Can't live like that.
...it's my problem, too.
Toi.  They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
Brad Kovitsky.
I think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.'
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
It's <u>covered</u>, okay?  I appreciate your concern.  Can I talk to her?
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
Feeling the pressure?
That's not wh...
You weren't passing 'em out.
Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
He only remembers I <u>found</u> him.  My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.
We have to talk.
Yeh, it's cheaper.
They don't hate you --
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
I know that.
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
What if he is?
What?
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
I'll be your guest!
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
Four brothers and five sisters.
No.
I'm still poor.
This is work.
No.
My Jesus
Jesus was not bad.
Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
Boys, take napkins...Napkins...
Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
Fine.
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
You know he hated my story also.
I'm going in there.
The same.
One in a million recover.
OK!
Hi, Dad!
Well, now you have.
Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
...gger.
Say, 'Nigger.'
Again!
'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Hello, is this Pam?
Toby Oxman.
Oh, fine. How are you?
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out.
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
Oh, I don't remember that...
Yeah.
It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.
No, I don't think so...
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
So where'd you get in?
Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
We're outta here--
We don't have time!
Because I'll be firing at them.
Rule two:  without alternative, use yourself as a shield.
I guess not Cooper...
We're on sublevel six.  We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--
Hey now!  No cussing on TV!  Well in closing I'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour.  One is my perky co-anchor here, and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people--people just like you and me!
You're going to pay for this...
Like where--in your dreams?
Shut up!
Chemco's been developing nerve gas?
Chemco is willing to deal with him, meet his demands.  I can have the money there in an hour.
The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!
How much do they have?
Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.
Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
That's right, fella.
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
Well, you can't do that because he's dead.
Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he?
That's government property, Major.
What did you say?
General Schmuck?
Not exactly, sir.  You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said:  "Sure, the orders came from me.  They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now."  Then he hung up.
I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
That's a very wise deduction, General.
I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
A shooting war!
But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
That's right, sir.
No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter.
No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
That's close enough, Major.
Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes.
I should say practically none, though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination. The trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations, and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all.
I want to talk to General Ripper.
Admiral Buldike?
I'm not certain, Mister President.  The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.
Well, just common sense, sir.  Thirty from thirty-four equals four, or my name's not "Buck" Schmuck!
Well, sir, if the A/C's a really good man, I mean really sharp, why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time.  A real big plane, like a Sting Ray, zig-zagging in, its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard ---  Has he a chance?.....Hell, yes!  He has one hell of a chance.
Lothar, take your checks now.
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
What?
Call them every five miles.
Maximum ECM!
Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
I think they mean business.
Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.
Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.
Roger, I'm setting up the CRM-114.
Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute.  Can you check your ECM?
Let's see...International Morse, I think ...K...E...O...P...E...R...E...C...A...L... L...M...I...S...T...A...K...E...O...P...E... Gee, I don't know, it seems to be some kind of code.
Forget it.
Skip it and jump, damn you!  This flak's so close, I can smell it.
I've got one.
Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
What do you mean?
Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
Look, this is different.
Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
But how are we going to drop the bombs if the doors won't ---  Hey, King....you're not thinking of --- You don't mean you'd --- ???
Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?
Well, I just wanted you to know how I felt. Hell, I know Air Command wouldn't have taken you if you weren't okay.  And don't think I don't know some of our best ball-players and entertainers are of Negro descent.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
Yeah, I guess.
Was it okay?
I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
Yes.
Oh. Well, what's it on?
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
Right now?
What?
No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
You wanna bet he's with a girl?
Okay, okay.
Okay.
Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
She's in the van.
Buff...
Yeah, right, publicist.
Well, that's one way of putting it.
I'm so burnt-out.
I will.
That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for that, mama!
Good. See you later.
You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
Please.
No, no, whoa!
You know? I remember coming here with my parents.
A reel?
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Okay.
Okay. We'll go for a ride.
It's nice here. It's different.
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
What about me? I don't have a car.
Oh, yeah?
Mm.
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
Taking care of business.
We were?
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Yeah, she, uh, works for the record company and takes care of interviews and, you know, shit like that, Uh, we were actually just doin' an interview and Erica said she's like to see Burnfield, so...
Pony and I are friends.
He's drunk.
Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole?
Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.
What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?
That chick, Erica?
What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off.
Just go home, alright?
Will you just put the gun down?
Is that Bee-Bee?
Look, why do you care, huh?
No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.
I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.
Like what?
Yeah.
I would've stopped it.
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
Us.
No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
Nothing.
Mm.
But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.
God, you smell like whiskey.
Wait. What, what are you saying?
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
What?
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Yeah, good.
Oh, man, we were pretty on tonight.
So how's college?
Like songs?
Yeah, maybe later.  Hey! Hey!
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
Oh, yeah.
Burnfield. No place like it.
Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.
You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on!
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
Hey.
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
I'm always serious.
I don't know. I say what I mean.
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.
Uh, eleven twenty-five.
You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Oh that's nice for you.
There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't cash".
Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
It's twins!!
Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out.  Heee hee-haaa....
Di?  I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
That's right.  Practice makes perfect. I'm practicing to have a baby right now. If we do a practice job, we'll not only get the experience, but also the extra money we need for guns!
Oh - okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  I'm gonna visit my mom!
Hee-hee-h-wait a minute.  Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?
He Ikea'd us.
That you?
Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
Kim-Lo?
I guess there's an exception to every rule.
It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry.
Definitely old.
Well technically, I don't think I'm a virgin anymore.
Uh...maybe?
Bank branch!
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
Before you?  Whoo-hoo!
More proof God's a guy...
I didn't mean to --
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
Action! The scene starts.
That was the general idea.
The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
Thank you.
How about the Rainbow Room?
As for instance?
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
You don't know how glad I am to see youl
Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
I tell you this is half sold.
So long.
See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.
Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.
Honest to goodness, I hate you.
It will?
You did.
Whose house is it?
Whose?
No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
Come on, Joe.
Joe, I can't look at you any more.
It's a good script, isn't it?
I don't care anyway.  I want the coffin to be white.  And I want it specially lined with satin. White, or deep pink.
Lady.  you've got the wrong man.
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
Or teach it a better tune.
Uh-huh.
Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
You can stay here.
Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.
Okay.
I've lost my car.

It's those feathers.  They tickle.
There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
What's that?
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
So he said it quite a few years ago.  So what?  I never looked better in my life.  Do you know why?  Because I've never been as happy in my life.
All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
Norma, grow up.  You're a woman of fifty.  There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.
Goodbye.  Norma.
It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night.
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
Naturally.  I brought them myself.
Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
She is upstairs.
It's just that I'm very worried about Madame.
Frankly, no.
Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.
Did he have a wife?  Did he had a girl friend?  Did you know them?
Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
Softball.
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
What do you want?
I have to.
Who didn't?
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
No.
You can't just abandon me.  Alone.
But I don't understand.
I don't see why not.
Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
Are you asking me for a "date"?
I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
How do I fight it?
What an adorable hat.
It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
I don't want your help.
I could force you.
Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.
Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.
The scoop of the year!
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
As brave as my father. As wise.
No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
She's a beast.
It was just a trim.
Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
You Scorpios can never take a joke.
Throw him out.
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools.
Then come with me.
Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.
First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?
Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
There's no vodka in it.
Brad.
No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
Too much mayonnaise?
I didn't --
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
Old ties are hard to cut.
Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
Mom and I do this all the time.
Sure.
I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.
Mmmmm . . .
First paycheck?
Yeah. A raise . .
Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
That what they call you?
Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.
Just the man I wanted to see!
God, that's what I keep you for.
I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
We gonna crash?
We back in Metropolis?
Sister! I'm his sister!
Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
We've already met.
Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?
Tell me.
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
But the other night...
And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks?
You've got to pick three more numbers.
Where's the handle?
Hello.
Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
Storms! Floods!
Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system. How about...hmmmm, someplace small...
Today coffee----
I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!
Don't cry, Bubba.
So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage.  We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite--
We can get to work on that oil!
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
Tourists, about twenty of 'em.
Do I detect a note of jealousy?
Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
Mr. Smith -  -- the "complimentary couch."
Maybe you wanted to.
Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
Oh, hi.
Never closed my eyes.
You're not selfish at all.
Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
Does she know about it? She's in it!
The minute the story broke I bundled her on the first Concord out of here. If Paris goes kablooey I want the best reporter I've got right there in the middle of it.
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
Yes, but it's not all I feel.
Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
I asked the right question.
To ski?
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
Constantly.
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
He ran in fear from us . . .
Put down Lex Luthor?
Now I shall have the Son of Jor-El as my slave! Forever. If not, the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance.  Beginning with this one.
I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
Free!
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
		DELETE IN CUTTING
Don't worry. I will draw his fire.  With a few of my own.
No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
What about here?
I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . I like you . . . I really do.
Let's sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony.
I'm sorry to see you go.
Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
Gee guys, that's swell of you. But  . . . I've got another idea.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
Go on . . .
Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
He has all of Superman's powers. If I've planned it right. . .
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
This wasn't in the plan.
Ready, Uncle Lex?
For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
You are . . .
Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
Nobody else.
One of them should've been you.
What's she doing in California?
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
Not really, no.
What the  --  !
He may have a gun!
You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?
Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
Jealous? Of what?
It isn't that I still don't like you, Clark. It's just that...well, once you've had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl.  I'm going to make some coffee. You want some?
Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.
Okay.  Take me to your leader.
Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
You think he's for real?
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.
The least we can do is leave him another door jam.
I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.
Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!
Tea?
Lex is going bye-bye.
What other one?
Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting?
It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter, Jimmy.  Besides, the chief of detectives has the hots for me.
Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
It does, huh?  Clark Kent, I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.
Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
Thirty-five.
I guess I...uh...regressed.
It is for me.
It's a Twinkie, boss.
Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.
Oh, Mr. Luthor...
Ah, dear simple Otis. Albert explain it to him.
Good enough for you. Now then --  --  tell me something I like to hear. As many times as I hear it...
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.
On radio waves?
For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong.  But how could you know that -  Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it.
Ally.  That was my nickname.
And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
Which one?
She didn't.
That's where I'm going.  To see her.
Yeah.
And she really liked you.  She would've given you all this if she'd outgrown it, or...
So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
Can't you make it later?
Sure.
Well I don't.
Yes.
What do you mean by that, Dolores?
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
For rabbits?
Berries.
And what's that?
Did they give him special care?
That would complicate things.
Yes.  He does.
There might have been a word or two that slipped by.  Maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure.
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
I didn't say that.
I'll just strap it on the roof.
I'll...take it straight.
Isn't it a lovely day?
Was he drinking?  Could you tell?
Would you like a cup of tea, Billy? There's a piece of cake left.
Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?
What, Mason?
Oh.
She...she was a friend of mine.
Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag.  I know my wife packed one in there...
Thanks.
A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
Yes.
I need money.
Who did they get for that?
Yes.
Yes.
Before the actual accident?
Dolores was driving too fast.
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
I was scared.  And there wasn't time.
Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
The ramp?
You and Mom have a lawyer?
Nothing.
I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star.  Not like you used to tell me.  Remember, Daddy?  All the people that were going to discover me?  Where are they now?
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
Yeah, right.
Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?
Don't apologize for me, Frank!
Coupla weeks.  For eight weeks.
Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
Otis was outraged when I told him Van Cleve was going to fire you. Tell him not to pay any attention to anything you-know-who says about you-know-what.  Right, Otis?
No, I wouldn't...
Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.
Did Sidney tell you about it?
History repeats itself.  Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this...
But that wasn't your fault, dear, what happened to Leslie.  I've told you that a million times...
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
J.J., Steve isn't...
Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...
No.  I'm going home.
Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.
Now don't kid a kidder.
She mighta jumped.  Love suicide?  Check it for me, Phil...it's a real heart throb.
Everyone knows Manny Davis...  ...except MRS. Manny Davis.
You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
How does it matter who's sister? The main thing, they're through and -
J.J., I swear to you on my mother's life, I won't do it.  If you gave me your COLUMN I wouldn't do a thing like that...
Yeah...  And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'...  You know J.J....!
Dallas?  Could be.  He doesn't look like a reefer smoker...
What kind of an act is this?
But what?
The renting agent and the tailor.
It won't leave much of a balance in the bank...  Mr. Robard?  Could you locate him?
I hate to see you like this --
I know you do, Sidney.
Don't you think it's about time you shut yours?  Who are you to tell a man like Frank D'Angelo to shut up?!
- and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.
Good!  We're all off to Utica, so excuse me, Mr. Frannis-on-the- Portisan.
Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.
You tell him, I stutter!
I wasn't looking for a brawl.  I came to bring him a present.  Wanna bite to eat?
I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother.  To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -
...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.
Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...
Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
Those lying motherfuckers!
NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that, Dyson?
Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
Smile?
No.
No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
No problemo.
She intends to change the future somehow.
Where you going?!
I'm sorry, John.
No!  Don't kill him!
Alright, it!  We need it!
And what it that?
I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move!
Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
Why him?
Then what?
Son of a bitch, I knew it!
Please continue...
I'm sure it feels very real to you --
I don't know.
I don't know.
And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
Your manner.
In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
No can do.
I have a duty.
But... he only wrote nine, Major.
The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwngler?
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
And what was that?
And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President.
How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.
Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
What?
No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
I'll tell you, then. The last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal Hitler had shot himself. Listen to it.  They listen. Did they pick little K's recording? Did they pick some other conductor? No, they picked you, and why? Because you represented them so beautifully. When the Devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. You were everything to them.
I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.
Do you know what's in this archive?
Show you?
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
So. You wanted to see me.
Who's he?
His private life?
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
Right. Claims assessor.
First oboe.
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
You're a big help.
I thought you did.
What's it to ya?
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.
The what?
Caught one?  You mean you got shot?
What?
You like it?  It's my first.
What about it?
Molecular-memory.
That's not my mission.
Fuck you!  Let go of me!
Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.
You'll beg for mercy in a second.
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
Then how are you supposed to get back?
Of course.
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
Alright, Ms. Connor.  Listen carefully.  You're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there.  Stay visible. Don't go outside or in the restroom.  I'll be there in a few minutes.
Okay.
I know.
To make a statement. I'm gonna give them the name.  Maybe the jackals can help us out for once.
Like shit, boss.
You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
Please, don't do that...
A bad month.  You did the exact same thing to me last week.
Don't just stand there, get help!
What <u>is</u> your problem?
Hold on...  They want your driver's license number.
Where are you going?
I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.
My hero.  Let's go.
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
Why... ?
That tall, bright building.  Near there.
Right.  Call me Christy.
You?
What's wrong?
Nicholas...
How?  How could they have gotten anything?
What are you talking about... ?
Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
What... what do you mean?
Nicholas...
They will!  You tell them if they don't come now, I will shoot you!
Fuck you.
That's not true...
No...
I have to show you...
Where are you going in such a hurry?
What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?
Studied acting, I assume?
Single?
Elizabeth?
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
No.
"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
Why?
I'll call them, okay?
I'm going to call.
Okay, okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises.
Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself.
Really?
No.  Do you?  Can't be too hard, can it?  I don't think we should be here out in the open like this.
This... ?  Oh, this is just... this is the bill.
Yeah.
Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
Have you gone to the police?
Of course you can have it if you need it.  Can I get you something to eat?
I'll call.  I really will.
No, thank you.
What's all this for?
Humor me with specifics.
Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...
What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.
Thank you.  Goodnight.
Ilsa... you're alright?
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
I'm just like him.
You're here for Conrad Van Orton? I'm the hotel manager...
It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...
His behavior... ?
A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
Follow me.
You know you can.
You're joking.
Sam...  Thank you.
Greetings fellow insomniac.
Well, I... uh...
Come on.  These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.
Yeah.
Sure.
Why?
You could have.
No.
The whole thing feels like experimental misdirection.  Like he says it's about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that'd be a legitimate study, but I think that we've been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he's really looking at something else.
All night?
You want company?
We can't stay here looking for her.  She doesn't want to be found...
Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer!  And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...
And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
But there's a sad catch to the story.
I got more scared.
Why?
And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
It's not real?  Crain?  He's not real?
Because that's where he burned them up, the child laborers from his mills!  Because that's where their bones are!  He killed <i>hundreds</i>.  He took them here and he killed them.  Their bones are in the fireplace!
Nell.  You will come here now.
How'd I know it was for you?
That?  That's Hill House.
How could you do this to people?
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
Can't say.  Haven't been here that long.  Well, it's Labor Day, gotta get to work.
No one will come any nearer than that.
I know.
You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.
I don't know, you know...
I don't think I want any.
Then let's go get you one.
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
Well, you're certainly not a person.
No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
It's not a knock.
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
What kind of food?
Why?
I'm a gracious host.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
Why not?
Okay.
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  There was no moon that night ...
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
Butcher's hook.  Look.  I don't much reckon those minders of his.
He's brought in the heavy mob.
Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
<u>Valets</u>.  They park cars.  He's having a party.
You goin' back inside?
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
Sounds like Beverly Hills.
Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
Not ashamed.
She never told Eddie, though.
Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
My employer.
Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
Eh?
My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
Ian?
No kidding.
I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
You're a reluctant traveller, then.
Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
Sounds like you need a rest.
I got half.
Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
Something's on.
"He ain't wrong."  Listen, I know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  <u>That's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
-- You know his name is Frank.
About Jenny.  Tell me about Jenny.  About the <u>deal</u>.  Whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard.
<u>Why</u> then.  Why did you do it!
Who?
Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.
Hello, Tony.
Pop doesn't like people smoking in here.
Geez, Mr Crane.
He didn't say that.
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
Ah... it's nothing.
Birdy--
Uh-huh.
That right.
No. I might be interested in that, uh, business proposition--
I can get it, yeah.
Cash.
That'll be fine.
Mm.
The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
He's staying at the hotel I've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. Must've seen us.
But it's...
Come on in.
So you paid the guy?
Told what?
My wife and I had not... performed the sex act in many years.
Honey?
So?
Mm.
I didn't say a word.
You don't have to tell me anything.
I took Doris's keys.
So... who... who actually--
...Well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. There was nothing left to mortgage; Riedenschneider went home and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway...
He a good man?
So, who should I--
I'm fine. Thanks.
Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
Huh?
Yeah, yeah--go home.
Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid.
What the hell are you talking about?
Yeah.
He's the dead guy.
Uh... you're under arrest.
He said OK. Is that what he said?
Why not?
It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest of you can go with Cuthbert!
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
Do they have to wear uniforms?
Where's the walk-in safe?
Calm down.  I found it!
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
That would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  One more question.  I see a big hole.  If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
Where the hell are you?
It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.
Where's the head?
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit.
You're kidding.
How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
We haven't got time.  You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight.
I'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that John is gone.
The virus itself might have positive applications.  They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made.  Greg isn't joining us?
I know.
You're asking me?  I don't even know how to load this thing.
Lovely bouquet.  After our last case, Vince took me out for a draft beer. As I recall we split the check.
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
I'm not giving up.
You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
You're right.
What are they?
So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
We will.
They fill seven floors.  We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens.  Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display.
And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
He's right.
Footsteps!
Don't be a wuss.  Come on.
Like this.
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
You're color blind.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
But at what a price.
Someone's been murdered.  Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn limb from limb.  There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
What's that?
It's reptilian.
How about lunch?
You were going to be married.
What happened?
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
I don't know.
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors...
I think... it means it's full.
It's coming.  Run.
You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
Today.
That's right.
It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
What have we missed?
As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.
Let me demonstrate some examples.
And the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.
We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.  As the show expanded, naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep Truman in Seahaven - demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk.
That's right.  Lauren.
--I'm not allowed to talk to you.
Saturday?
If we don't go now, it won't happen.
I...I can't.
Yeah?  Outta what?
Nursery?
Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?
How about them?
When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island?
Yeah...
What's that?
Truman, you're gonna be late!
It's a surprise.
They're...  perfect.  Thank you.
Gee, that's great.
I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.
You blaming me for the traffic?
I'm sure they're just exaggerating.
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
Fine.  I'll tell her.
Were you there--how do you know?
I don't understand.
Yup.
Sorry. Don't have one.
Me?
Working with?
Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. I realize you're very lucky to be alive Agent Scully. The ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the Justice Department. Until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation.
Brought on by what?
Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
What's that?
We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
I know the name. Why?
Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
And one little boy.
Do you?
What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.
Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
You can't.
Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
Where are you, Scully?
What's wrong, Scully?
The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
I'm in the vending room.
-- Mulder! Get in the car!
All I told them was the truth.
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
No.
We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
I've got a hearing tomorrow --
The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
I don't know, Mulder.
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
-- of what exactly?!
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
For the purpose of what?
We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
Just like that --
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
I don't know anything about that.
And they want to blame us?
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway.
Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
He needs to be turned over.
As far as I needed.
Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.
I realize that...
You don't know the procedure.
It doesn't have much to do with science.
What did you see?
This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his.
Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
You're sure of that?
Okay, okay...
Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...
Absolutely.  Abigail...
All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
That hoist, with the winch...
Delano?
Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...
Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
What else do we do?!
That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
Yes.
The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.
Just another part I've got to learn.
Well you read this.
Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
Where is she?
Oh...
Thank you.
They're Harry's.
I don't know.
I was a friend of Harry Lime.
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
I'll carry a copy of one of your books. Harry gave it to me.
Yes, of course.
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
It wasn't petrol.
Well, you could say that murder was part...
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
Going to find me the real criminal? It sounds like one of your stories.
I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead.
Calloway.
You're not locking her up?
Do you mind if I use that line in my next Western? You can't chuck me out, my papers are in order.
In Vienna...
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
I said you win.
Well, there's not much time.
I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
This way, miss.
I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.
No, no. Leave them for a while.
No, I don't know...
I know a very good dentist.
Certainly.
Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
Of course, of course, of course.
Yes, Hindu dances, thank you, Sergeant. This is the first opportunity we've had of making an American author welcome.
She's been arrested.
And - Anna...
You can get somebody else...
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
But he said he died instantaneously.
How do you do.
All right - I'm mad. I've seen a ghost...
Must be some mistake.
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
What's he saying?
Why didn't they bring him in the house?
Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
Ah, er war gleich tot - I mean, sie war gleich tot - brauchen kein angst zu. Ein moment...Wart ein bissel...Wartein bissel. Fraulein Schmidt!
Who else?
Yes.
Well make it your business.
Of course there was. Some ice for Mr. Martins.
A novel, Mr. Martins?
Okay.
Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -
Thanks.
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
Yes.
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
Not too bad.
No.
One night I will get the perfect photograph.
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.
The Zionists aren't Nazis.
Who the fuck are you?
Then I won't bring you....
Read <i>Mein Kampf</i>? Hitler had all his best ideas in prison.
You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
He's at a home out here.
Why?
Why not?
What assholes.
No difference.
About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
Oh, am I learning it faster than you did? Maybe I'm smarter.
It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.
Do they?
Okay...  Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.
Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?
Who's Eichmann?!!?
I'm stealing it.
We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already.
Obviously.
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
I've been waiting all my life for something like this.
German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
A poison...?
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
Notice? Like what...?
I don't know. Is that right?
So you're saying it's not true.
What were you, following me?
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
How did you...?
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
A forty-five.
I was just talking. I -- look, I can't help what I think.
There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.
I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
So what Jew would you kill first?
Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
They're not my people....
Number ten.
You could do it.
The mother.
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
You said they didn't have night guards.
Four. But no one this important.
Do I give a shit?
No.
Obviously.
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
Yes.
No.
I can't... I just don't know how to...
Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
What kind?
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
Italian is practically the same thing.
No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
In a lake.
Congratulations.
What was he like, when he was little?
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
That idiot!
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
Six seconds.
Then tell him to wax it too.
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
You don't have a room?  Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.
People say that?
Ahi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia! Where...?  God, she'll kill me...  ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.
Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
As I said, second of all you're too skinny.  You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
You don't need a stretcher to take her with you.  You know that, don't you?
I don't want to erase anything.
... Yes.
Thank you.
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
... both.  Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo.  I work for an insurance company.  So, I decided to take a few days off.  I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous.
I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
No?  Huh?  Yes, of course!!
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
I got fired.
Uh... Ah!  A story?
No... tell me.
... Not at all.
I didn't dive.
... Nothing.
Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
I saw how it has to be.
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
It's my apartment.
The whale!  How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!
Louis, we were French!
Again?
What?
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
Haven't you been listening?
No.  I'm just depressed.
They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
Of course, that's what they're for.
Coffee might be nice.
Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.
What's your first move?
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
Please, call me Mordechai.
Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.
Yeah, no kidding.
Sure. Why not.
Keep going.
Oh, she said that, did she? What else did Mommy Dearest have to say?
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
We go to the same temple.
Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.
Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.
The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
That depends. How much money has he?
Drink your beer and don't get so excited.
I drink.
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
Let's get in your truck.
But he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl.
I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past --
Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it "fits just perfect."
Hey  I'm over here.
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths  that's what this procession is supposed to be.
I want to ask you something.
That's right, of course.
It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
But he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair.
I don't know.
I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
Why do yo&amp;i accuse me? You don't know what you're doing -- you don't understand -- nobody understands --
To know where that leopard went -  I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little freshwater college back East. I gave that up.
Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone 
I thought they came right past here 
Professional hunters, who rid the state of cougars.
Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.
Offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit? No. I'm in office to protect the taxpayers money  not throw it way. Come on, Charlie.
I thought - is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.
Now look what you've done.
Don't be soft.
And I suppose you don't feel bad!
Yeah.
I know. Funerals.
Maybe I want to feel badly.
I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
What! You can't be --
It's all right. I'm not hurt.
Kiki, Galbraith said something to me once, -- something you ought to know. We were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel --they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves. That's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way.
Aint nobody out there, Mister.
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes majordomo. They are expecting you.
And that is the last time any...
Can it be that you want your brother found?
Disney! How inter...
Oh no. Youll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
Perhaps I should come back when youre...
Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:...  Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight Im convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.
W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?
You do want me to keep the job, dont you, Mrs De Moraes?
Paul Lamont...?
Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De Moraes...
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
It must be tough being married to Adonis to end up sleeping alone every night. Sleep must be hard coming. Whats harder? The thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if? Or imagining what he does with his children?
No!
I didnt know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? Ive known for five years. Hes known Ive known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesnt speak about...
Think what you like. But dont presume to understand.
You splendid bastard...
Something like that.
Something like that.
I didnt intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that youd been back.  That wed argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldnt help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
He... He is dead!  MY HUSBAND IS DEAD!  Call my parents. Theyll tell you. Call them!
I dont know. Everyones dead...
You wouldnt understand.
Yes. Im trying to reach a friend but I cant get through. The number is 01766 770 471.
Can you tell me how you spell...
Croissants. Like that...
Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe.  So, black coffee and a couple of crescents.
Europe...  France. Im French but I live in London...  ... England.
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
Yeah.
No. A poor little rich boy who thought hed save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition.
I thought youd never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... Theres a tough lady, I thought. Just the kind who might help me...
Im sure Ill find a way.
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
Italian? The Mafia...?
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think Ill get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, itll be too late.
Shell be alright. Shes tough...
Jee... Fuck... Youre fucking mad!
What?
The company. We all work for the company.
Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, thats what they do to their employees, isnt it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining peoples lives. Thanks for the lift!
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, trs bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandmes services quelquun rcemment... Vous tes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie... 
Yes. How did...
Recommended?
Leonard. What my daughter is on about, Mr Lombard, is that Leonard is somewhat of a Bohemian. You might as well know that...
Do what, Mr Lombard?
Jah...
Is my money in there?
Look, I dont think youre fully aware of what youre playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why dont you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?
Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?
Youre making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guys not one of Friedmans...
Ho-hotel... Los Angeles... He...
Three oclock.
I dont recollect mentioning a friend.
Yes. You wouldnt know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.
Reach for it and throw it to me. And... My fingers on the trigger, you hear!
His mother would be pleased to hear that.
Im afraid I dont understand.
Im sorry. Its just you dont look local...
The nineteenth... How come you didnt know?
Id appreciate it if I could use your phone.
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesnt appeal to you...
Excuse me?
I know his work better than I know him.
Alors quoi?
Figlio di puttana. Youre the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...
The acid bath?
Let me give you a tip, asshole - no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in London and here tonight and hopes to get away with it. It upsets people. Its wrong. Fucking wrong.
If he had, youd be dead.
Of course I am, it's just that...
Very generous of you all.  How much?
Now?
Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
To marry you.
Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!
But it is what I want.
It would not be the same without you.
I'm staying, Jean.
I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
I don't remember.  Maybe.
Yes...
Performing a miracle.
What are you doing?  This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
To hell with procedure!  We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church.  Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
But where are you going to be?
My name is Jeanne.  My little cross I had round my neck was taken away from me.  I would like to have it back.
I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry...
Buying her?
But... her army's so small now...
I'm... I'm not the king...
He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I -- Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France.
She says she'll be here tomorrow...!
I can see her if I want to.  I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?
No doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause -- but what about the ordinary soldier?  They don't fight for causes these days. They fight for money.  Who's going to pay them?
There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...
Noooo!
That's not a lot.
I know...
Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
Damn right!
I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
No...
That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
We still believe in you, Jeanne.  If it were up to me, I'd chase every goddamn Englishman into the ocean. But it's not up to us anymore -- it's up to the king...
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
Oh?  You can't remember?  Let me help your memory...
So your memory's coming back?
Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
In His name??
I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?
What are you doing on the wall?
Do you think this cross will protect you?
I don't think so.
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
I'm sure he'll forgive you.
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
Why did she have to die?
I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
Jeanne, be patient.
A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
You can't, it's too dangerous.
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
Yes!  It was...it was unforgettable.
That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
He'll be back before curfew.
Just over a year.
Let's find out.
Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
Who's recruiting?
Do they?
Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back.
Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
Warsaw's not the only radio station.
Just shut up.
Three lousy zlotys. And there are people here making millions.
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
So, what's the news?
You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
Toilets?
Not this week.
Wladek! How are you?
Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--
If you need help...
It's a little cut, nothing.
Where are we going?
Out of Warsaw. Where?
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
To be deaf?
... without a shred of manners.
The Alps.
Mother used to sing the songs in German and her voice would echo across the valleys
Ohhh ... dear. Not another word From the shock, yes it would be.
No, no bible readers.
Nothing just yet
No.
You mean in signs?
No, not words.
I'm sorry, I can't do that.  I don't have the time.  Goodbye
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
I just want to listen.
She says, throw the piano overboard.
You've missed this bit.
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
He'll probably fall down.
I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
No.  Never saw him before.  He's a dick, though.
I had some appointments.
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
Shove off, Duff.
You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
I did.  That stuff I gave him was counterfeit.  They'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it.
Aw Christ, it doesn't make no difference now.  If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else. He never gets anything first...Damn, there's no answer at Luther's.
C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
You mean you blew it.
I picked something up on the way.
And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.
Yeh, it was easy.
What do ya mean?
I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.
Did he say he wouldn't?
Naw, I'd just blow it.
The wire is ten years outa date.
I also gotta win.
If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.
He wants to put a half million on Syphon.
Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?
Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay- ducer a C-note.  You find out the deck?
Pass.
The name is Lonnegan.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
All right, I'll give ya a break.  Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left.  Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this...  ...in the back and run it through right away.  We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.
He'd like to kill me.
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
You know me.  I'm just like you... It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody.
He cheats.
Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.
Give 'em a little time.
You got a system, Carver?
I didn't get the bet down in time.
How am I gonna do that?
Don't think I know him.
Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.
We'll get it, and if we can't, we'll just make it up.  Grand larceny, extortion.  Counterfeiting, anything you want.
No.
With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet.  Either way you end up with 40.
Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya.
Sure.  Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.
He'll never do it.
He was?
You know how they are... sex...
Is that what it means?
Just a minute...
Said he stole his invention.
Nothing.
Go!
What are you talking about?
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
Do you know where he's living?  Oh....  Well, at least I'm glad he's all right.  Thank you for calling. Goodbye.
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
I'll do nothing of the sort.
He wouldn't say.
What do you mean?
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
Oh, thank heaven.
Yes.
Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
Oh, yeah?  People fall toward a shot, you know...  not back from it.  I knew you were lying.
I bought it in a pawn shop.
What would your mother say to that?
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
Only in bad weather.
Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
We were looking for this bird.
What's he want of you?
I'm asking you.
So you say -  Go on, Bob.
I'll have to try to remember.
What do you mean?
They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
I'll check on that.  I'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.
Nunheim!
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?
Goodbye.
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
Never mind.
That's all right.
So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
Oh he as clever about that.  He called when you were out.  That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.
What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth?
Hello, Mimi.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.
Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
So I did.  I saw him lying buried in his shop.
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
Listen.  "Studsy" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they....
This is your party.
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
I hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner.  Nice food, isn't it?
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
That last Martini.
We need ice.
I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
She brought it in.  Trying to make me believe she did it.
Maybe it would if I took it.
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
Breakfast.
He'll be here.  Give him time to get his trousers on.  Where's Asta?  Asta!  Asta!
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Yes.
What's the matter with you?
No reason.  Just a hunch.  But I'm going to find out.  I'm tired of being pushed around.
I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
Looks like a hold-up!
You wouldn't be a widow long.
It was his body that was buried there.
Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?
Couple of months anyway.
No.  Nobody but you.
Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
Yes.
It's the only way it makes sense.
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
Mr. Charles - she did - that's why he got sore at her and killed her. Listen, Mr. Charles --  I did do a little chiseling.  I come to bring it back and fix up the books.  I didn't want him to find out and come after me -
Police!
No... no.
Oh, yes -- yes -- that's right -- 
I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!
You did.
Y-yes.
Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here.  You don't learn it in a couple of weeks.  I studied it in high school.
Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.
Oh, God.
No, please, not again.
We're going to keep driving.
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
For climbing.
What do you figure it to be?
Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to--
Move!
Maybe we should split it up now.
Maybe I do.
You said he was a deserter.
He tried to kill us.  If not just now, then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.
There might be something in there.
OH MY GOD!
Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.
Cool it, Jaeger.  Hey, Wes?  Wes?
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.
...I know.
I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.
I got that...sir.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
Mine.
I heard it.
Just relax.
We're going to get off, all right.  We'll get you off of there.  Just...be cool.
It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.
It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.
It's the treasure, that's what it is.
Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.
The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
Stay low.
Just stay down.
If they land, we can take them.  If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about.
I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...
Jesus, Jaeger.
Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work.
It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.
We need something:  A flare, a signal mirror.
We'll lie.
I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
Well, we should identify ourselves.
Probably.
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
I just said I would.  I don't think I--
I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform on.  He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
I don't know!
You come up with a better plan, let me know.
You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot!
No, but I figure now's a real good time to start.
Somebody has to.
Threatened to blow my brains out?
A map?  All I got is maps.  I'm gonna have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here.  What kind of map you need?  Topographical, geographical, thermal?
Just...want to be ready when we do.
I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
I'm saying don't do it accidently.
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
For real?  A treasure?
Yeah.  So?
Like I said; so?
What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?
It doesn't mean anything.
The only thing I worry about is how much Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over.  The only people who I've got anything to worry about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when I come rolling at them; an M-16 in each hand, and a grenade between my teeth.  Now if you'll excuse me, soldier, I'd like to get back to my box.  I've got a treasure to find.
Hell, we'll just buy our way out.
I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--
I know you're a pussy.  I know that.
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.
Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
Yeah, we're down.
He lived through that?
All last night he could have been--
4732...?
You've seen enough.
Don't go.
I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
What?
It's 3+27 hundred
But...you...
Don't let them separate us.
They don't know.
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
THX and me.
You have nothing to fear.  You're safe again.
Where is LUH?
I want you for my roommate.
It will be good for both of us. I've got it all arranged.
I was lost.
No, I...
What kind of answer is that?
I don't care.
Where's LUH?
My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
You are a true believer.  Blessings of the state, blessings of the masses.  Thou art a subject of the divine.  Created in the image of man, by the masses, for the masses. Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.  Work hard; increase production; prevent accidents, and be happy.
Yes...
No thanks, Bev.
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
Hey, look--
Oh yeah? Prove it.
Then let's go see what they missed.
Yep.
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things... 
Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
Would you?
I was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register.
A bowling alley.
Reilly! He's loaded!
Security.
Maybe she knows your old man.
Look, it's important.
No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
Fuck factor ten.
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
Nah, let's just take a look-see.
Ain't that a shit--
What?
I thought I told you--
Report on the case so far.
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
And diamonds in the front.
At once, Jacques.  We'll continue later.
Where did you find it?
erect in sweater, arms folded.
I had exactly twenty thousand lire. I had just cashed a traveler's check and put it in my wallet.
Well, he knocked at the door. You see, I was expecting two--uh--two business associates.
So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.
No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
You've never been in Constantinople?
Now see here, my good man. I've had just about enough of your insulting remarks!
The type they marry.
If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron?
Um-hum!
No, not at all!
And you will be out by tomorrow morning.
Otherwise I'll call the police
What is it?
What do you mean?
Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
We'll take the Royal Suite!
Darling!
Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
What time is your rendezvous?
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
Yes.
Yes.
I know that niche.
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
Oh! You didn't read it!
In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.
Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
What?
Yes!
Right!
This used to be my secretary's room.
You think that's too much?
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
And so will M'sieu Giron.
Um-hum ...
Good night.
Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
Like that?
I know all your tricks.
So you think you can get me?
What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
Giron...!
Divine ...
But it could have been glorious.
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Yes--uh--
Jacques!
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
Ever had a romance with a crook?
But you saw it here.
An hour, two at most.
She knows.
You wanted to see the propellers?
The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee --
That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...  ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other.  Search him.
Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.
Can I bum a cigarette?
I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
If you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat!
Well, here you are.
That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
Is he your boyfriend?
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
I see you.
You wouldn'ta jumped.
Just move with me. Don't think.
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
Sssshh. Come here.
A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean.
It's so cold.
Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized...
I can't feel my body.
Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.
It was a dreadful, heavy thing.  I only wore it this once.
Just tell us what you can --
I'm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett.
Goodbye, mother.
Do you want the truth, Anya?
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
I didn't ask you to come away with me--
--and I can tell you where to get off.
Glad to see you again.
We'll save you a place at our table.
Yes--and <U>very</U> popular-- 
Guess again, copper.
And me coming in with two pair-- 
That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?
Yes--
You're not very ambitious, are you?
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
I'll be there--Good-by.
Lonesome?
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
Good night, idiot!
Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
I'll be waiting on deck.
What's the matter?
No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
Change?
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
I'll take one. 
What is it?
Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
<U>Me</U>!
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
Much better--thank you--
No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
Why?
Thanks. That makes us square.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
I should say not.
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
Knots!
I thought I put you to bed.
Who won?
Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
Everything O.K.?
Do what--
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
Very serious?
Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
I'm getting seasick--
Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--
So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
So what?
Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots.
Eh?... Oh.
Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
Thanks to me.
This is interesting--  Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
Say, "Thanks very much!"
Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
Thank you.
If he comes near you again, I'll break his neck--
Let me look at it.
Then why did you run away?
Why Ed, what an ugly thing to Say!  Does this mean you're not my Friend anymore?  You know, Ed, if I thought you weren't my friend I Don't think I could bear it.
Come and get him.
Oh, Jesus, Johnny...
This brand.
But wait, you don't understand-
In pace requiescat.
Here it come: one-two-
Say when.
Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!
I been having the boy at the Hotel pack us up every night Since your streak started
Yes, but there's just something About him.  Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I Hate him.
Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan.
Ignore her?
No...
What does he want?  He wants revenge.
Then what do I do?
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
Sorry...
I'll pay you 500 each in advance And I'll mount you on those.
Good God, you're really-
Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in.  Should've held out for more money.
Never even heard of anything like it.
Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.
Well you're different, no arguing That.  But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it.
I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.
Don't worry, Wyatt.  My family's rich.
Well, excuse me for askin', Milt, But isn't it kinda dead in here?
I think I'll just lie down awhile
Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
All right, well, good night.
I don't know.  I'm all right.
Sure I'm sure.  What is this?
Will you go to her and tell her Right in front of me she's Nothing to you?  Right out loud so I can hear?  Tell her she's Nothing, tell her she's nobody, Just dirt?  Will you do that?
Forget it, Ringo.
If I had to explain it you Wouldn't understand.  Just say We're brothers to the bone.
There's all kinds of horses, Ain't there?  Same with Cowboys. What they do's their affair.  I Don't preach and I don't judge.  I Ain't no dog-catcher.
Drop his horse.
They're wise by now.  Which is Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs.
Might as well hear him out. Anyways, what choice we got?  But no matter what happens, see It through to the end.  If you don't I'll curse the day I ever laid eyes on you.
Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.
I know, kid.  I know.  Me too.
Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Listen Mister, I'm getting' tired-
Just like any other hard cases. Gotta know how to handle 'em.
I know, I need a keeper.
Kinda, actually, yeah.  I gotta admit.
Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.
Yeah, and dangerous.
No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-
Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I should buy it for a book! It's totally preposterous, but -  You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I can amuse you.
...Words to live by?
Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.'  ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?
Where can I find him?
Ah, James. You always were a cunning linguist... Au revoir, mon cher.
- We all want what we can't have?
No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want -  Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy.
Is this another one of your games?
Nothing.
Do you?
He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!
Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers.
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
How is old Q?
Fishing?
I see...
I believe Q's exact words were:  "Hopefully, nothing."
Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?
Hell. The CIA built that club.
He tied one on.
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
Think about mom.
No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
What?
You are seriously deranged.
No. I'm going with you.
My father left me the business.
Don't say it.
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
You insist on calling all the shots.  And by the way: I am not a helpless girl.
Next time, I do the driving.
If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear:  We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.
I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
Forget it. No way. I got here first.
Captain Morton.
Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the message. So will his boss.
Approaching the first gate.
Entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target -
You come with me -  You stay here.
Fueled and waiting.
Yes. Shall we kill them?
It's Bond!
Thank you sir! Thank you!
One to seven: Deal the face cards.
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
What is it, noontime?
Why in the h...
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
Boy, that is the real South. That is real corn liquor.
Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
What happened to your hand?
He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age.
Why didn't you catch a plane?
You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
Hattie is a different person now.
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.
Speaking of tappy heads, we ought to have an old fashion fish fry.
What's a toby?
I thought you weren't old fashioned.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
He is in his pigeon cage.
I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
You can bring ONE toy...
See?  Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them.
Let's let Molly open one.
I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
Not today!
What's with him?
So, you see?  We're friends now, guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?  You bet.  Gimme a hug.
Did I get my package in the mail?
Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
She's sick!
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
Have you been replaced?
He tortures toys -- just for fun.
How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!
Come on.  Let's get out of here.
Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?
Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
Sir!  No Sir!
So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to worry about.
Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up. I know you're tired!  I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me?
Huh?
Right here, Woody!
Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
Got it.
There's no mirror.
She got away.
I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
Let me in.
In my pocket.
It was only a mouthful!
Did you now.
You're late for breakfast.
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
I don't know what you mean.
He never came home last night.  Was he with you?
It's very hard for me to come and tell you this.
Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal... and Salazar.
I want to believe you.  I really do.
Arnie, thank God.
Why are you talking like that?
Arnie, this is crazy.
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
I know I made things worse.  I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you.  Something only you can help me with.
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
What are you thinking, calling me at home with a message like that?  You've compromised me and our relationship --
Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming right now --
Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed.  I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal.
Drugs begin pouring out of America into every other country in the world. Canada is completely overwhelmed.
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --
Barbara --
Look, I'm as worried as you are --
I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.
Me, too.
How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving?  You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.
Somehow, I don't see that happening.
Will we get invited to the White House?
Sixteen
Yeah.
I'm a National Merit Finalist.  I'm on the Hi-Q team and the Math team. I'm in the Spanish Club.  I'm a Thespian.  I'm Vice-President of my class.  I'm on the volleyball team.
What is this, like freebase?
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
I think so.  If she didn't she should have.  I've only got maybe an hour.  Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.
I'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.
So does half of San Diego.
No --
Yeah!
I have a job for you and I don't have much time.
When will you do it?
There's always a way.  If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him.
Carl and I were friends from childhood.  He was loyal, that's not a mistake.
I don't know.  Perhaps I remember something.
I don't believe you.
It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
Who?
Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up.
Where?
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
I'm aware of that.
It's possible.
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
She snuck away.  And we haven't seen her.  She hasn't come home.
Like you protected Landry?
What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
Your dad's a doctor.  Call him --
No. On you go.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
I've no fucking cigarettes.
Let's face it, it could have been wonderful.
Shut up.
Right. You can't sleep here.
No, not holding hands.
Is that a promise, then?
Smells like it.
It's Iggy Pop.
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --
Oh, really?
Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
The pleasure was mine. Best interview I've ever been to. Thanks.
No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back.
It's no problem.
My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
What do you mean?
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
When are you going to visit him?
You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him yet?
It was just an idea.
About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London.
Your favourite dish.
Yeah.
Sure will, pal, sure will.
Are you serious?
Six weeks.
I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you.
So what's it going to be?
But where?
I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.
No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
And how did you breach the Barrier?
Then I shall make use of this starship.
All right, we're lost.  But we're making good time.
Pavel.
Position, Bird of Prey?
What do you know of my pain?
I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott.
If we could send a distress signal...
Why didn't you beep my communicator?
Perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain.
That's great. I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? What... Bones, what are we going to sing?
Yes, Spock?
Goodnight, Doctor.
Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.
I cannot be certain.
Why?
Damn.  Let's go.
That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
Mr. Sulu. Execute.
Yes, Captain?
The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
Hmmm?
It's all right, Captain.  Proceed.
In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually.
No conditions.
  
"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.
Maybe you could wait until I'm a wee bit stronger I don't think I could take it in my present condition.  Or yours.
I cannot go with you.
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
You haven't told him?
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
Uh... got any cinnamon?
I know, I met him.
Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
You call that getting over it?
Hello, Alan.
Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking, and people will stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some data through. See you tomorrow.
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
Right on the money!
There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
I... have come to communicate with my User.
Oh, you want to -- hah. I could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here. They hate this tower. They'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around, in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while. And you should hear the way they commune! Sounds like they were routing a payroll, for all the heart they put in it. No, I don't think you
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
Tanks...coming back. Let's go.
Greetings, program...
You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
A little ...  Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...
Lousy utility companies ... they're the same wherever you go.
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
You're getting out of the business?
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
We have to.
That's all going to change, Yori...
Don't know yet... I have to get in touch with Alan. He was going to tell me how to
So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
Then you better do something to				* jumpstart that man's motor.  You know... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion.
Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.
Where are you off to young lady?
He lies!  I was there!  I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
Yes.
This is impressive, gentlemen. Of course, it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was.
In the helicopter.
Yeah, right.
Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-				* fundamentalist.  Linked to					* numerous car-bombings, that cafe				* bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year.  Major player.				*
You tell on me, I tell on you.
Sorry.
No!  Never!
But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--
Those wimps.  It's because I use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going.
Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
Me too.
I'll handle it.
It's okay, don't bother, Harry.
They must've just missed me.
I can't, honey.  I promised Allison I'd go shopping with her. Sorry.
I don't know anything about a faction.  I just met Simon...  or whatever his name is...  a couple of weeks ago.  I barely know him.
Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.
Yeah.  I suppose he is.
No.
The code name of your contact will be Boris.  Your code name will be--
No.  Doris.
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
Go down there and kill everybody, I guess.
So what's your angle?
What about the husbands?
I always have a couple on the hook.  You know.  There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog.  It's great.
Hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn!
No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
He said he was an American agent.
Fuck you.
Cairo was a day at the beach next				* to this.
Yes.
Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.
I just glances inside.
His wife.
What letter?
He wants to speak with you.
Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.  What do you think would taste good?
How come?
Now hang up.
It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.
Want some Goobers?
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
I took a cab.
What do you do?
Where are you from.
Would you like a bite of my pie?
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
What would make you think that?
You're not stupid. Just wrong.
That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, "Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it." So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.
I don't believe so.
What?
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
You don't know him -
Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
Really?
I heard that.
Take that shit somewhere else.
Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.
That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that.
I'm her husband.
No thanks.
Fuck you! My mother was Apache.
You got it.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
Tomorrow.
Ask him if he got the letter.
You goin' out?
Every word of it.
Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
Elliot.
Two guys.
No shit? Dick, that's great!
Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late.
This is our last chance to play "what if". I want to do it. I'm just scared of getting caught.
I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
Who's Sonny Chiba?
- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not puttin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But, don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some guts.
They'll be along.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
I bullshitted him.
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?
McTeague.
Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got myself a new place - mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place. I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla.
Where'd you come from?
Absolutely.
Look, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire department, the L.A. Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the twelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust.
Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.
I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?
Naw, he ain't home right now.
Exactly room-mates.
Are you Dick Ritchie?
Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
This is it, James...what you've been working for.
I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.
Forced you!  Why would someone force you to take drugs?
It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything.
I have to go.
July?!
1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
And I was in it?  What did I do?
Nevermind.  It's not real -- it's a hoax.  A prank.  He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here.  Left!
Who's keeping an eye on you?
James, why don't we...?
You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James?  You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.
I thought I was in...prison again.
It was?  I didn't...know.
...I had a dream about...something like that.
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.
I remember you...like this.  I feel I've known you before.  I feel I've always known you.
On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, "We did it."
Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
Not as bad as what they're doing to kitty.
Wiping cut the human race!  That's a great idea!  But it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals.  I didn't say a word about "you know what".
I'm here about some monkeys.
I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all!  For the future!
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now?
She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
He's been tested for drugs?
Were you listening?  We got two officers in the hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.
You want to go in?  Examine him?
James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
I said I was sorry.
Christ!
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
We was born to die, boy.  From the minute you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your head.  You just don't know where, or when, or how.  Don't make sense worryin' about the particulars.
That's my morning's pay.
Will be.
Out of here.
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
Yeah, I can fix it.  Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Don't look like nothing.
That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
There you go, sweet talking me again.
I want my car.
Let me have a Beck's.
Yeah, give me the Miller.
You pay Toby no mind.  He just likes to show off for his girl.  Give him a couple of hours, he'll cool off. Still want that beer?
I think I burned my gun hand!
What do you want?
Don't tell him anything.  He can't do this.
I don't know your real name.
What happened to your hand?
No trouble at all, really.
I just drove in this morning.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
I couldn't stay in this place.  I wouldn't.  I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out.
I guess it must.
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
What?
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
You live pretty good.
I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--
What about us?
I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
I don't know.
Wait.  What about . . . him?
I . . . nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell . . . that's all.
You liar!  You wanted him dead.  You seduced me into killing him!
Now what?
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck?
Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
I'm her husband.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
John Stewart.
I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
No.
I had a problem getting my car back.
I was hoping we could talk.
About what you said this morning.
I need thirteen.
Be quiet, boy.  I'm thinking.  It can't be done at the house.  It should be . . .
And tell her what?
I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
Came close this time and it scares you.
Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
You came to take my wife from me?
Liar.
I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
What?
Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
No, I don't want to take you for a ride.  What I want is for . . . Hey, you don't happen to have a hundred and fifty dollars I could--
What the hell are you talking about?
That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
You expect me to believe that?
Stand up.
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
Give it to me!
Not as bad as it looks.
I don't understand what the--
Sure you do.  Everybody in town knows about the money Jake kept hid in the house.  It's a wonder the Mrs. here just now got round to killing him.  Not for lack of trying.
But, Senor--
Senor, you need a doctor.
You can't do that yourself?
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
All right, old man.  Christ.
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
You expect me to believe that?
You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Who the hell are you?
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
Grace, tell him.
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
Ah, I can smell it on you.
I do.
I like Darrell.  He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money.
You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior.  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
What?
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
Cause she's dead.
Oz.
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
Get away from me!
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither.  Then of course the clouds come in...
Darrell--
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
You believe that?
What?
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
What sign?
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
You sure you can manage?
What happened to your hand?
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
Those are white words, not ours.
You could leave him.
Walk away.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
I'm sorry...
You don't have any money put away, do you?
At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.
Because I know you're full of shit.
I thought you couldn't get your car.
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
You think now that Jake's dead, there's all that money there and I don't need you anymore, and I might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop!
Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.
...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
One way.
I'm sorry.  It's just ... you know ...
No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got Miller.
Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?
You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.
Oh.
Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
Jesus.
It's finished. I won.
I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay.  I think that was the first time.  Does that count?
Seventy-five percent.
In college. A car accident.
We've already begun.
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
You thought he was carrying a knife?
But not a knife?
That's not what I witnessed David.
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
I want to sleep here tonight.
How much can you lift?
What if he wasn't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him?
Get mom.
All of it.
That's great.
Is that right?
No.
No.
...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
And what was that explanation?
On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
Shit and fried eggs.
Enemies, Bob? You been talking about the Queen again? On Independence Day?
He admit it?
You an' Andy get the hell out there. Find out where them other two went.
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
Porch. I'm puttin' a porch on her so's I can puff my pipe of an evening an' drink my coffee an' watch the sun set.
I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed.
Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.
Duck, I says.  "You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns." 
But he was called...
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
Well, Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. Meanin' the best. On account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
I was gonna kill them two by myself. It don't take three.
You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him.
If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
After a ways.
Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
Shit... I thought they was gonna get us. I was even... scared a little... just for a minute.  Was you ever scared in them days?
First one what?
Yeah?
Lemmee see it.
Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
Ned... Is that you, Ned?  Ned, I seen... death.
Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...?
Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
Three? That ain't bad considerin'.
The Kid, yeah...
You gonna share your half with him?
Yeah?
We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
See that scrub oak yonder?
How many you killed, Kid?
Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
We don't need him. The two of us could do it.
You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
No good. He needs guarantees. He says... his life is in danger... He has seen the Devil... looked him in the eye.
He says he knows his face. He sees it when he closes his eyes.
I don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it.
Umm ...
This whole thing was a shakedown.
The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
What do you care what he says?
Did you hear what he just said?
Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at
They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more.
Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill you.
Tough break.
Russian, I think. I don't know.
Just do what I tell you.
I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
You know damn well, dead-man.
A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.
I've got a ton of work and no good people.
A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
Tell him we'll meet.
I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
I know he was good.
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
What lawyer?
Convince me. Tell me every last detail. 52    SCENE DELETED                                                              52 53    INT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                                  53                         + Kovash's room is now filled with people. Jack Baer stands next to DANIEL METZHEISER, a balding man in his forties. Next to him is Doctor Plumber. Across from her is Ridgly Waiters.
Kobayashi.
Keaton always said: &quot;I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.&quot; Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE.
And this is why you never told the D.A.
Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.
This is totally irrelevant.
I said I never heard of him.
He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.
He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.
Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's
As far as we know, nothing.
This is a nuisance suit.  He's looking for small change.  He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
How did you settle on the amount?
And no one will know the truth.
Mickey told me to come back to work.
Gruber...
Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please?  Bishop Brophy's office ...
Yes.
Yes.
She THREW UP IN HER MASK.  Let's cut the bullshit.  Say it:  She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...
I'm just an M.D.
`Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes.
I'm on the staff of...
Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
You may step down.
It's a crime.
I wouldn't do it.
I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
There's nothing they can do to me.
It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
Yes?  Galvin, right?
That's perfectly all right.  I'm kind of rushed.  Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
Her doctors killed her.
Okay.  I'll meet you here.  Tuesday night ... I gotta go.  You going my way?
I didn't do it, Mister.
My client can't walk, your Honor.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
That happens.
What?
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
No, no, you listen to me.  All I wanted in this case is an even shake.  You rushed me into court in five days...my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn.  I'm going up there and I'm going to try it.  Let the Jury decide.  They told me Sweeney he's a hard-ass, he's a defendant's judge.  I don't care.  I said, the hell with it.  The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
Mr. Concannon...?
How come you're calling me from...?
Yes.  Price...
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Yes.  It was, actually.
Maybe what?
And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
Do you want me to go...?
You're talking like a drunk.
I...do you want me to leave?
And what makes you so tough?
Is there going to be a later...?
You, you don't under...
It's over!
What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?
I'm going to help her.
Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.
Right.
Mickey:  I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
I can't talk now.
...one of the other nurses?
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
I don't want a mistrial.
... But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson ... and they called him  up and said to come out. He's a good man.  He's only trying to do what's right.
Hi.  How are you doing?
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
Yes, the roving nurse...
Huh.  And why is that?
Should I?
Me, too.
Then?
We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?
That's Carlotta Valdes.
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
What about?
You won't have to.
-- and how you happen to be living here.
But you haven't lived here long.
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
No.
Honest?
But Scottie, you don't have to!
Ah, no!
Yes.
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
No! Let me go!
You can't. You're afraid!
And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
This afternoon.
No.
Oh! Yes! Here!
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
Wander about.
Some people prefer it.
What?
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
No! No, thank you!
Good-bye.
Well... anywhere in particular?
Madeleine!
The tall trees...
Yes...
No!
What?!
Home?
No... it's in shadow.
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
All the time.
There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.
I stood alone on the green, searching for something, and I started to walk to the church. But then the darkness closed in, I was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and I fought to wake up...
Too late... there's something I must do...
To the church, I must go there.
Carlotta Valdes?
Does she sleep here? Ever?
Would you please go and look?
What car?
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
It's where you belong.
I'm having one now.
Three whole weeks.
I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
Where?
Oh?
Oh?
Oh... this and that.
By whom?
Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
Can we have it by tonight?
I didn't hear you.
First of all...
Multiple reasons.
You're not a team player.
They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
You fucking bastard!
You want to hear me out?
You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
What are you talking about?
Why?
There's more.
Sure, why not.
So I didn't fucking do it!
Have you ever done this before?
I am not flexible on this.
We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
What does that mean?
At the seven-eleven.
I don't give a damn.
Adam! Calm down.
It has worked.
They won't figure it out.
What?
There is no candy!
They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin...
I know...
What happened? Oh my God...
It has to be done.
I got you.
There's more.
I'm with Tina. Is she there?
I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
Not tonight.
Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
I'm not talking to you?
No.
However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
What are you going to do?
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
You need help.
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
Moore?
True.
You have a King fantasy.
I love you.
It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't.
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
Sent it.
Well it's bad timing.
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
You don't like Moore? Since when?
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
Of course.
What kind of seats can we have?
Nesting?
I'm mad at you.
I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
Well, can you come back inside?
Are they fighting?
Yeah. You.
No.
Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...
But...
What does that mean?
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
OK, OK. You guys just go back in. Dad, keep going with the toast, we'll be right in. Go on.
At the newsstand on 3rd.
The wahoo?
The wahoo moment?
Yup.
How do you know she's dead.
I got to agree with that.
Greenpeace?
Where?
That's what I'm thinking.
The stone age.
It's a present from my parents.
So you didn't come from the poorhouse!
Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.
No.
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
Whatever you like.
No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
Wasn't that cowardice?
It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ...
Go away! Leave me alone.
Yes, sir. Good night.
I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone.
It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...
Fifteen yards.
Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
Nothing.
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
That your cousin is more to your taste.
If you free me, you'll be a rich man ...
One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I?
That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
Are you Jorge?
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
What's he called?
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
A black bull came.
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
Why wasn't I told?
You mean a nanotech synthetic organism.
But only you will know he's not human.
Why'd.. .you pull me out?
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
What about them?
Then I guess we're even.
Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
You think he's smart?
Got it.
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary reassignment.
Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing?
You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.
Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
I was assured the problem was corrected.
I understand... I understand perfectly.
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
What's wrong with Parker?
Talk so I can understand.
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
All my work is my finest.
I think I understand what you have in mind...
Of course you are.
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
What you need is a collar.
I know who would know.
Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him...
Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're readapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
Because this painintheass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.
...I think so...You?
Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...
The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
Okay.  Okay.  The <u>Suitcase</u> Bomb...
I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...?
All we have to do now is sell it to the President.
Hi, How are ya?  <u>Listen</u> to this, willya...
...twelve years.
Come on.
What rig?
When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.
Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?
They caught him in the closet with a Girlscout.  Side- effects of a pill ain't gone trump that.  You have to keep'em guessing for  Two weeks.  You  don't have to Cure Cancer, Pal, you just have to give them something more interesting than...
We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election.
What's it gonna cost? 
...that's the general idea.
...<u>nothing</u>...
<u>Hello</u>... Yes.  We'll be back...?
...I just hope...
Anything at the Airport?
An <u>Albanian</u>, a young Albanian Girl.
...this's <u>good</u>...
<u>So</u> forth...
...Stanley Moss...
I'm doing my job, Too.  Would you give me a... do you think you could call off your Dogs for a minute.
Uh...Didn't we <u>do</u> this?
Oh.  Hell.  And what do we do now?  What do we do <u>now</u>? Boy Producer?  Mister Win-an-Emmy, Social Conscience, <u>Whaleshit</u>, save- the-rainforest, Liberal hire-a-convict <u>shithead</u>? Mister Affirmative-Action Peacnik.  Commie... <u>shithead</u>....?
Well, he doesn't have his Green Card.  He Doesn't have his Greencard.
Guess who <u>I</u> am.
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
ON THE MEN, IN THE ROOM, ARGUING ABOUT THE ILLEGAL ALIEN, SCHUMANN IN THE B.G.
It falls to me to <u>reveal</u> to you a <u>secret</u>.  To reveal the existence of a secret group of warriors. Men, yes, and <u>women</u>, trained and pledged their <u>strength</u>, their <u>skills</u>, and, if called upon, their <u>lives</u>, in the service of their fellow Americans. A group so secret, its very existence has been known to just a few, and known not by a Name, but by a Designation Number, Three-Oh-Three...
...we own it?
..."down safely," crew perished in the Crash....
Does it <u>have</u> to be Albania?  Because, lookit:  I can get my hands on a lot of walking-around-cash, I think, if it's <u>Italy</u>...Look at the tie-in here:  <u>The</u> <u>Boot</u>, "Givvem the <u>Boot</u>,"...

Yeah, I need a list, people in Military Special Pro...
N'who might <u>you</u> be, when all's said and done?
This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.
That's what I'm telling you.  The two things:  the two things:  Rare strain of flu, No Cause to Be Alarmed.  And the B-2 Bomber...  Clear me a space.  Get me a copy, go rob one, get it off the computer, Wash Post, N.Y. <u>TIMES</u>,
Have him say, 'I know we're all concerned for the President, there will he an update at 5:45.'
How you going to stretch it?  This won't hold for eleven days.  Guy fucked a twelve- year-old...whadday're gonna do to hold that off?
...uh ... No, that's...
Is that true?

And get me the Fad King.  No.  Get him First...  We don't need an Act Two?

All the greater accomplishment.

Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.  Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks.  Labor, five bucks an hour.  If you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour.  If you <u>help</u> ... if you <u>help</u>, a <u>hundred</u> bucks an hour.
We <u>were</u> the Albanian campaign, John -- <u>We Were There</u>.
Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...
They insist they wanna go with meeting him at the airport.  I told'em they're wrong, I can't convince'em. They're concerned that the last kid had the <u>Wheat</u>. Variations include, the kid is a <u>boy</u>, the kid is <u>twins</u>, it's a little <u>dog</u> ... they rub meat on Schumann's cuff, the dog runs to him...
Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.
We're going home.  We're going home together...
He's doped to the <u>Gills</u> ...
"...unsure whether or not Enemy Action..."
They'll be here in ten minutes.
No.  You're right.
It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.
Keep Talking....
Too Texan.  Go with the stick.  Thanks.  <u>What</u>...? ...does it have to be <u>Albania</u>...We're locked into Albania...why?
Leopard Skin...
Isn't Johnny Green in the... 
Can we give'er a <u>kitten</u>?
Better.
Yes.
Surest thing you know.
Well, you  said it yourself, earlier, and if I may rephrase, that the success of the President, in the Polls...
By the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.
I'm just talking about the Hats.
A beret.
...their Leopard Skin Berets....
Yes. 
...of kittens...
Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>...
Tell those spineless toads we'll self-insure if they don't write it... You fire 33 vice presidents and nothing changes...  You eating twinkies today, Bud, or are you schtupping some stewardess...
Sell it all.  What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.
Oh really.
Sounds like a french word, what is it?
Yeah, where's your machine gun.
Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
Get the hell out!
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
Now! Tell everyone to dump!
Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.
Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.
Not in here Dad... please. Later.
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
I met them before you were born.
No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
What'd you tell him?
Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.
Let's see, it closed at uh, 41 1/8...  Up a quarter...very attractive... about average yield...
So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these? 
...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.
It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport?
Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...
Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
What about it? You work hard. I'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought. And where'd it get you?... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory... Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. And I'm not talking a $200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being "comfortable", I'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50-100 million, a player Bud -- or nothing. You had what it takes to let through my door. Next question: You got what it takes to stay...??
Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. Where do we stand?
My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72.
I think I got some friends that won't mind making some easy money...
I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
How much is enough Gordon?
Obviously...
Oh yes, I remember you.
...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.
You could have a great beach house for that.
Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.
Upper West Side.
Break it.
Yeah, almost...
Well, why stop at that?
I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.
You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...
I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?...
Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.
Businessman!
Yeah, yeah, OK
Thank you Jenkins
Thank you
Uh, wrong picture Tony.
What?  Tony and China, together?
China
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
That's not true.
I know he does.
So much.
A ghost?
No.  But once I heard...
Try to communicate with her somehow.
Can't hurt.  And I think it's important you find out what she wants.
Nope.
What do you think?  Guess.
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
Um...yes.
You do?
Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
Um...sure.
I don't know.
I should be going anyway.
Of course.
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
Good.  I'm good.
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
Yep.
Please.  That's all I need.
I don't...
Shhh.
It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her.
It's alright.
Did I?
Please.
Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
I know.
What is it?
He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures. They're all psychotic.
We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
Fine.
You are...
We did.
Shhh.
Tomorrow.
I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
Really?
Oh, no...
No.  Look!  In the window.
She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.
Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
Yes, tonight.  We're going to be--
Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
What can it hurt to talk to someone?
I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...
Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
Yep.
Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
You told me that I was...
When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
Yes.  The ghost.
Wouldn't go that far.
DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me. Go!
...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
How did she know where it was?
I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
Yep.  There's some great places nearby.
Huh.
Don't think so.
You don't have to do that.
I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!
Rowan's already called the hotel, Michael.  At the cemetery by now, I would guess.
There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you.   Take off your gloves, Michael.
I want to see my mother.
Nothing worse than a common tool.
I don't want it.
When did she die...?
Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -
I under5tand.  All the same
It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
It wes a dream...!
ENOUGH!!!
Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.  I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now.
If you knew how I yearn for that...
Go away!  I don't want you here.
It's too soon to know.
I LOVE MICHAEL.  MICHAEL!!
I love Michael...
Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
Leave me alone!
Ju1ien was your father   Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. All one in the same...  That is why he fought carlotta for your life.
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
Like this...  LIKE THIS...?
I guess so.  The trick is remembering how to act like one.  I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you.  Why don't we go to my office...
Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
The one time I want it to work...
Rowan...
What're you - a mindreader...?  Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
He fools around with his patients too.
Okay.     y'all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah.
Captain's orders.
Than letts get rnarried, Michael.  I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes.
Their what...?
No.    This is unreal...
That's not funny.
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
Just nervous.  Getting married, you know.     Got the rings...?
I plan on liquidating almost evetything.
The one on the left - definitely...
I really don't know what to say
Tell me about your adopted MOTHER
Did you?
It was wrong - all my life I have been cheated - cheated of anything good - I shouldn't have been born - I was a mistake - my natural mother was a whore - that makes me...
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
I am sorry...
What was I supposed to do?
There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
You killed my friend!
Yes I can...
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
What's this all about?
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
No worries
I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about...
I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
You and your pep talks.
That's Charlie.  My best friend. He's into beef analogies, partly because he's a butcher's son, and partly because, well, he's just into beef analogies. What can I say? He's also a photographer...
That vibe is from your wrist, pal. You've been over-tenderizing your meat, again.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
Perv.
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
Not ever. Never.
Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk.
Jealousy is so unattractive.
He kicked major ass and you know it.
From your lips, to God's ears.
Yeah?
So that's a maybe?
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.
We own a small family grocery store.
Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...
Well, why should I?
We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.
It's okay. You need me?
Some of them have to be automatics.
Hi ho, Silver.
I always knew there was more. I felt it.
Hmmm?
What do you want me to do?
But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.
If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right?
We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.
Everything.
But how can you respect yourself if you don't?
Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
I didn't forget.
From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big.
Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
You never know around here.
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
Your dad taught you everything.
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
He shut down your paper!  You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!
Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
Amen to that.
I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.
Oh. Goodness.
You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
As much as possible.
Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.
I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
Really? So I'm doing OK?
--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
Aw, come on, kid. Throw me a bone. I'm your uncle for gosh sakes.
I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
It's about your parents.
Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.
The teeth doin' any talkin'?
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
She still work there?
I understand.
He was large?
I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that.  He said, "No little girl can ever make me come."
I'd like that.
Suzie Toller is missing.
Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
Lombardo's settlement?
Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
You got it.  The rich got richer.  While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp.
I net a guy in a bar.
I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again.
The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.
We don't know that, Ray...
So you were alone.
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
You didn't cuff her?
Yeah.  But I got my bike.
Lombardo ever come out here?
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
I think we just need to get wasted.
You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
You're out of your mind.
I'm not on your property!
I was raped.  By Sam Lombardo.
I won't.
Do it to ourselves?
Stick?
Yes.
Okay.  I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool.  All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.  I'm spending my money.  It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds.
Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
I love you.  Now give me the line.
You think that's wise?
Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.
Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
So Suzie, you called us, remember?
Sit down, Lombardo.
Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
Put Kelly on too.
Are you mad at me?
Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
Starting with a screw?
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
Then we've got our proof. Excellent.  And where do we find this fortunate scientist?
That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
It's better than nothing.
Relax.  We're almost there.
This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  I spent three years on the stage, you know.  Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear.
You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!
Where have you been?
He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
I don't like to lose, either.
Fine, I'll stop.
Private train?
Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
Yes sir.
That'll be all, boys.
I deal with some tough customers.
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
Right.
Then come with us.
Yes...?
She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.
Me?
What is Tir Asleen?
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
You're not a woman.
Too bad you're not more like your father.
I don't believe you.
Good.  How long will it take?
You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
Friend of yours?
You don't know anything about ba- bies.
Absolutely!
Of course!  I promise!
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
I thought you had her!
Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.
You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
Ahhh!
No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini...
I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
Me!
Shhhhh!
More!  More!
No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
Surrender!!
Me neither!
Ouch!  Let go of me!
Shut up.
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin.
Maybe milking.
Not one this big.
They're Amish.
John, I don't understand any of this.
I thought I was the English.
No... I saw the man who killed him.
You don't say.
...I want to say a thing.
Yeah.
The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
Who else knows?
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
We do not go into your courts.
I would not be too sure.
Only the elders.
What?
Two days.
Something wrong with buttons?
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
I'm going this morning.
Not long... A few days.
There was.
No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
That's your way, not mine.
Well in the City of Philadelphia, God needs a little help!
Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens 
Johnny, what the fuck?
I hear you.
Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid. You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch  I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense.
I admit I don't know where he is.
He's got my number.
Yes.
No...
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
You are acting like one!
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
They are English. They don't understand.
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
Oh -- all right.
You wicked old witch!  Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!  Don't let her take him -- please!
There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
Is morally, ethic'ly
The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
Who are you?
You are?
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
This?
Oh!
That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
How did you guess?
Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.
Oh, no -- no!
But you couldn't have been, could you?
No --
My mouth -- my mouth!
...Oh, did that hurt?
All hollow.  Oh --
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
Lions and tigers and bears!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Hah!
Did they hurtcha?
Ohhh!
I think I'll miss you most of all.
What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?
Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
Here -- here --
I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
Oh --
You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.
It did?
Who at?
Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
This way!  Come on!
Yeah!
Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
Imposserous!
Whozat?
Yeah.
Ohhhh -- it's me!
Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
Yes.
Well, that's you all over.
Yes -- how about Dorothy?
It makes you nervous?
Well, I --
You promised us real things -- a real...
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  Hes not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the subs reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
If I dont get to the Boa before he gets to Maidens Tower, M is dead.
Like riding a bike.
But what if...
We cant.
I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. Hes a man of great integrity.
Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle.  Largest landlocked body of water on Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.
I was the one who brought that money in...
Who?
That which does not kill me makes me stronger.
Which is neutral, no doubt.
You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  Shes beautiful isnt she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. Hes decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette.
Its not the pin your father wore. Its an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
Youre not going to.
I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  Ive never told anyone that.
We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
You do what you have to do, but Ive called in M.  Shes en route from London even now.
Soon shell be everywhere.
Five more turns and your neck will break.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
Bond, Im a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal familys, now its mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
Have some of the rats nest caviar.  From my own fishery.  They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House.
Whats your business with Elektra King?
You are out of your league.  Shes working with Renard.
No!  Get me out!
How appropriate.
What class sub does your nephew run?
Still no contact yet.
Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
Wrong answers?
Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
Adrian -- you've lost it.
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
Memory lane.
What are you up to?
All right.  Mission accomplished.
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
That's because --
What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
Then why don't you ask him?!?
What does this mean?  What does it --
Am I free to go?
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.
Ever see one of these before?
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
Just remember, I'll be watching.
That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
You're a jerk-off, you know that?
Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called "Ahab". Whatever it is, it cost him his life.
Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?
"Anarchy" 99"?
What do you get if you finish?
He gets to be the hero.
I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. And it's a mil two, max.
Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
Look at you. You're helping run things now. You're a gangster. I bet that snuck up on you. You woke up one day and you were a criminal.
I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said.
A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
You can't welch on me now. We had a deal.
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
Alright, so I'll get more.
Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand.
Here we go again.
First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two, I don't wanna be here either, so just step off. Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out, I'm gonna get some rest.
Why you dogging me up?
A parachute. This does not argue well.
He's a pretty good actor, though.
Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
It'll work faster if I have an account number.
Of course.
Had to do what I had to do.
"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
... until he found tungsten.
We all do.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.
You know, you --
Sure you are, sport.
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
What if I like the pain?
What if they're naughty?
Were you now?
What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?
You're backstage at the encore of creation.
In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?
What if it never happens?  What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery.
To find Rogue.
I'll go.
What?... miss me?  Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.
If she held on any longer she could have.
Enough for a test.
And I'll never understand terrorists.
Not at the cost of lives, Max.
What do you want with him?
The way what is going to be?
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
Victor Frankenstein.
From your office, sir.
Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.
He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
Yes, sir.
Baack!
Of course.
Oh, darling -- so will I.
Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, darling!
Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
Darling, you mustn't worry so.
Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
Does that include the key to the laboratory?
I think you must be mistaken, sir.
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
A week.  Ten days at most.
Break that old man's violin.
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.
You must be Igor.
I'm sure we will.
Yes, just the two.
I wonder what's got into them?
No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.
Was he any good?
Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down!
You've got it, master.
I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
You're right!  Self-pity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner.
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.
I'm not trying to be funny.
Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
What did you find out?
How do you know it was a 'he'?
Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
It's the only way.
... It's.
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
Ja, ja.
Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while.
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
Perhaps we'd better leave.
I thought it was wonderful.
Me?  Sing?
I think so.
What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
Not fooling around.
I know Frederick.
It wouldn't be fair to her.
Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.
MMMMmmmmm!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
There must have been someone else down here then.
The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.
Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!
Food!
Food!!
I listened extra careful to your "Stand To" this mornin', Boy. ft was peifecL I couldn't 've done it better meseif, not even when I was Bugler to The Duke Of Wellington.. .now tell me, where did you get that black eye?
If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"
So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
Thank you.
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.
