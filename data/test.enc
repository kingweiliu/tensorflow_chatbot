Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Why?
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Hi.
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
Well, no...
But
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
Where did he go?  He was just here.
Great
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
Where've you been?
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
In 9th.  For a month
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
But
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
What if she never starts dating?
Oh, God.  It's starting.
No, but
That girl -- I --
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
Number one.  She hates smokers
He's pretty!
You told me that part already.
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Hey -- do you mind?
Yeah
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
I just upped my price
A hundred bucks a date.
Who's that?
He always look so
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
You're not okay.
Like you could find one
I thought you were above all that
Oh, so now you think you know me?
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
Wholesome.
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
The Partridge Family?
Then you screwed up
You up for it?
State trooper?
No.
Answer the question, Patrick
My grandmother's .
That ' s completely adorable!
I know.
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
What plan?
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
What?!
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
You can see for yourself.
I could be gone for years.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
They took everything...
May I ask by whom?
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
What does he say?
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
You defend yourself admirably...
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...
How did you manage it?
Father Marchena!
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
All of them!  Just lies!
What are you saying?
I believed in you...
New worlds create new people.
May I speak freely?
Do they have such thoughts?
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You bloody...
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
Are you married?
You considered becoming a prostitute?
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Oh.
I let her take a shower.
No!  Nothing happened.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.
I'm gonna propose.
What's he looking for?
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
I'll come with you.
Mind if I ride along with you?
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
Can we go up to the crime scene?
Is it drug related?
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
Alright.
Alright.
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
Yeah.
Okay.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
How old are your kids?
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh, look, you're sweating.  You don't have the balls.
How much money are you carrying with you?
Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?
This all you want?
Don't fool around.
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Turn that off!  Get the bags.
Turn that fucking thing off!
How you erase this?
Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
I did.
Why not?
Let me get a shot of it.
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
You got that?
Emil???!
We spent it!
It's easy to learn.
Isn't he a little moody?
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
Yes...he's my friend.
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
How did you start the fire this time?
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?

Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
Okay. 
Really.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
I suppose the idea was specialized training.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
Well, that's something.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
You're kidding.
I guess not.
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
CONTINUED
I'm having a party tomorrow.
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Fortunately, they did.
That's true.
I understand.
We don't wash 'em, ya know.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.
Yeah?
Bullshit.
No way to start a partnership.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
We eat when I say we eat.
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
You okay?
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
How did they get away?
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
You look awful.
I got to wait for a call.
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
I'm all wet.
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
Thanks for the coffee.
Great place for lunch.
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?
No wonder you're so popular.
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
Hello.
Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
Whaddya think?
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
You're impossible...
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
How ya doin'?
You want to go outside?
You sure?
Five.  On credit.
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!
He's a she!
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
Is there anything that can stop it?
What are we going to do?
It's a miracle!!!
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
Yeah?
Hello?
...Priest...
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
I'm sorry..
My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here!
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
Six to the left. One to the right.
Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
Don't you open your messages?
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
You're nothing but a... a...
It's up to you now, Angel!
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
Tell me...
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
They just landed in the desert.
Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Am I disturbing you?
...Not far, now.
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
Your clothing reeks of it.
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
Hello?
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
What happened to you?
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
You should have.
You're killing me...
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
What do you want?
What are you talking about?
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
You brought the money?
Excellent.
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
Is that him?
Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
You're a dead man.
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
Yeah, who's this?
What's he talking about?
I'm gonna kill you.
I want his name.
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
You got absolute zero.
Do it.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
You're making me very angry.
You almost went over your limit.
Give me the film.
Give me the film.
Big date tonight?
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
... Hello... ?
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
You don't need to be here.
Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
You... you need to go to the police.
Hello... ?
Hello?
I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.
So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...
Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
Her belongings?
Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...
No, sir, he is not.
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
Alice, you think you can leave?
You in a hurry?
You've been up all night?
Not really.
You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
T-T-Thanks Alice...
Hey, Rick!
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
I gotta get out of here.
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
Who says I don't like you?
Thanks for everything, Dad.
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
What?
I've got to write some of this down.
Where are you going?
Poor woman...
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
These things are wild...  What do you think?
You, too?
How is he - ?
My father!  He's not - ?
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
You hear that?
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
Well?
What about down?
Course and speed?
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?
You're sure it's Cyclops?
What's the running time?
But - what can we accomplish?
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
He did!
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
Well, I'll be - !
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
Are you alright, Wade?
Always has been.
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
You heard the news.
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
He's on to us!
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
I'm okay.
Double A. New Britain.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
Like you and Gordon?
Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?
On your sleeve.
Sure you did.
Saw him do it?
Open the door, will ya?
Did you do that when you were a kid?
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
It's fun.
No what?
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
Are we going in this?
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
What do you want, then?
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Please don't cry. Please, honey.
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
You don't want the extra police pay?
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
How you holding up, Wade?
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
I won't. You interested?
You and Mel Gordon?
Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.
The key, Wade.
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
See. Get your boots.
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
You okay?
I'm sorry.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
Money.
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
Going somewhere, Margie?
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
Marg!
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
Yeah.
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
Call it what you want.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
I don't know. You tell me.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
You don't want to say hi to your father?
I don't drink coffee.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
Daddy...
Got it.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
But they start executing hostages in
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
Why?
How many others killed?
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
What do you know of my husband?
Do you have to be so brutal?
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
Twenty minutes?
Finally, we can bargain.
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
How did your speech go?
What are you doing?
Where are we sending it?
What's going on?
White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
It's bait.  Don't take it.
You give me ulcers.
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
My god. I think that was a MiG.
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
Shit.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
Kruger, Sagittarius.
What is it, Mary?
Oveur.
It's got to be stopped!
Elaine.
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
What are you doing, Ted?
Elaine.
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
Simon just ejected!
I guess this is a first for you.
Simon, what's happening?!
Can't we change course?
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
Intermitant failure in scan mode "R". Analyze.
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
No.  Poached.  Over.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
You folks need any help?
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
Do you want to talk about it.
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
George Zipp said that?
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
Rain.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
Good-bye, darling.
Good-bye, darling.
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!
How ya doing, honey?
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
Excuse me, Sister?
Do you feel all right, sir?
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.
I like my horizons narrow.
Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?
He didn't recognize me.
When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.
Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?
Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along?
Well... yes, quite possibly.
A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
... and so, and so the doctor says, "If this is the thermometer, then where'd I leave the pen?"  You're not... you don't think that's funny?  George, work with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
She's going to divorce me.
What was that about?
What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
But there's no more drug.
How do I look?
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.
Can't lock up...
Could it be intelligent?
I'll go.
I get the picture.
You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
If I go.
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
So.
How do you feel?
Yes, Hicks?
Sir, the CPU is on-line.
Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!
We got problems.
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
Let's go!  Let's go!
They're in the approach corridor.
They'll get us.
Locked.
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
Thanks.
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
Range twenty meters.
So what do I tell this guy?
And how are we today?
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
I guess we're not leaving, right?
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth.
Burke!  Open the door!
Can we dream?
How many colonists?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.
How was I? Tell me honestly.
What did you think of the music?
You have leave to try.
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
No!
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
What's the matter with you?
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
How much will you pay him?
Where's our friend?
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
What a strange young man.
Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
A-flat, Majesty.
Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.
I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
And German?
Excuse me, but how old are you?
Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
Would you tell me why?
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.
Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.
Do you always live like this?
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
Yes.
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
Why not?
You don't have secrets from me.
Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.
Papa, is this your idea?
Why? What has happened?
Sssh!
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
Ah. Italian?
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time.
No, please.
I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
What?
Shall I answer it?
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
With the tenors.
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
I am so ashamed.
What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
Leave me alone.
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
All Vienna has heard that.
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
What anger?
Ballet? What ballet?
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?
Here I am, my angel.
Well, promise then.
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
That lady is back, sir.
Can we come in?
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
Can I be of service, Miss Price?
Oh, Miss Price?
What exactly did he call out?
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
It's a full moon. Where is he?
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Yes.
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
Mr. Kessler?
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
Aw come on, Alex!
I was. What are you reading?
Do you like it?
Hello. You all right?
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
Are you better now?
Closet.
Let me go now, you'll make me late.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
No what?
He all right?
I think he's a Jew.
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
There were witnesses?
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
Jack.
You're talking about the woman I love.
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
That's a wolf's head.
Okay.
Hello.
Nice looking group.
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
Heathcliffe.
Nice doggie. Good boy.
Nice to see you.
Thanks a lot.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
It's you, David.
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
Get out of here, Jack!
A monster. I know, I know.
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
Dr. Hirsch?
Yes?
Hot chocolate?
Then you have some hot tea?
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
He has?
Yeah.
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I
What's the matter, Charlie?
I remember once when your account checked.
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
Say, you can't do that
Oh!
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
That don't do us any good.
What do you mean?
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
know, but
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
Why are you so anxious?
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.
I'm feeling fine this morning.
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?
I don't know.
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.
Helen!
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
You haven't got a uniform?
Oh, make that uniform blue.
It's all right. Thanks.
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.
We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and
What time did this thing happen?
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
You're lying!
That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.
Yes, sir.
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.
I'm afraid so.
Why?
Yes.
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.
They must have turned him down.
Did you talk to him?
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
He was in the bank yesterday.
Dude Finlay?
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...
Uhh, yeah it does.
We got a problem here, brother?
That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick.
Bob. I didn't...
I'm sorry, Cole.
Yesterday.
Corn gonna shoot at me?
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...
The Army can hang him.
Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.
Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...
Beg pardon?
He's planning a job.
How?
Where you boys going?
Hands off your hip, Cole.
Not now.
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.
Jesse, we got to have a word.
Still smells fishy.
Fine. We hit this bank.
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want.
I think one of 'em's glass.
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --
Another dozen out back.
The safe. Now.
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.
Boys...
They're gone. What are you --
He thinks this is some kind of game!
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.
Frank, don't you have something to say?
She's still talking to Jesus.
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
And we're good at it.
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
We're drunk.
You taking sides against me, now, Frank?
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
Riders --
Jesse, are you awake?
You shouldn't be up.
You're sick of my company?
Yep.
I am so sorry, Jesse.
Let the law --
I don't understand.
Let me see that.
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
You almost ended my career before it began.
That's what I would have done.
The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.
I like that.
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Not at all.
Well, this land is about to be condemned.
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
That.
What the hell is that sound?
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
On a lot of lithium?
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish. 
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.
Luis is a despicable twit.
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.
I haven't seen you around here.
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
We should do it.
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.
Why don t you just go for Price?
I want a firm commitment.
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?
I think you should go now.
Don't come back.
Carnes? Wait.
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
Patrick? Is that you?
What...is...it?
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
I'll do it.
Tell him I'm at lunch.
Anywhere you want?
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.
Patrick Bateman's office.
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
So, what's the topic of discussion?
How old are you?
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
Do you feel that way?
He had a yacht?
Don't you know this?
So was I.
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
Had his apartment been burglarized?
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.
I'm so hungry.
Speak up. Come on.
Shhhh...it's okay.
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
You don't wanna move, do you?
A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
What!
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
That was -- different.
Great!
Here we go.
Right. Wait. A toast.
That'll be a test, won't it?
You're living here?
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
What?
What?!
There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
Milo? I'm Danny.
'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?
...Hello?
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
"Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice..."  You left my party to send E-mail?
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
Hasn't affected his work, though.
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
Every entry was authorized.
Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here, anyway?
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
Did you wanna be alone?
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
That's great. I -- didn't know.
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
...Milo?
What about the FBI?
Do we post it on the Net?
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
Bring it to the other location.
Latitude 47 degrees.
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
Did you download Corey? In San Jose?
That kid's the great white hope.
I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.
Oh, and Austin...
Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.
She's working on another lead right now.
Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
My God, Austin, what have you done?
Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
"You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
We can't just sit here, Austin.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
Fancy a nibble?
Why?
You're smashed, Vanessa.
No, did you use a condom?
Who?
Does that make you horny?
What do we do now?
I'll hurry back.
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
Austin, I'm coming with you.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
Don't mind if I do.
Noooooooooooooo!
Shut up.
Ahhhhhhhhh!
Ow! You shot me!
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
In due time.
Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.
You didn't answer my question, Mum.
What do you want to do, Scott?
Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
Flower ...
He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.
I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
You
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
Such as?
The result would be ...
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
Do you?
I thought we were on our way.
And I suppose you're the knight.
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
No thanks.
Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie.
Strange.
But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
I must say, you look more your old self --
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
For you, Mrs. Peel.
That's what we were working on.
Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
Do you always drive this fast?
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
This must be the last straw.
Where am I?
Was I?
To kill me?
I could save you the trouble.
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
Aren't you coming?
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
Mrs. Peel?
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.
Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.
Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
You're not venturing alone, surely.
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Think she really killed those agents?
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.
This man -- did you see him?
I was hoping you could tell me.
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
In your operation.
You with Mother or Father?
No, please! I beg you ...
Bang-bang ... you're dead.
What's happening?
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
Cole...
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
Great car.
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
Cole, we've got to talk.
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
Let go of me!
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
I don't believe you.
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
Ilene, are you crazy?
Why is Cole here?
I hope Ilene's all right.
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
That's it, prick lips.
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
It's true.
Hookers beat you up?
Is that all the coke in the place?
Really?
I'd love that.
Mr. Thomerson, I...
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.
What the hell is that?
Now, don't get into any trouble.
Hey, you guys...
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
Can you believe how perfect it fits?
Wash it to the windows?
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
You know Knowlton pretty well?
People actually used to pay you for this?
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
Goddamn it Stephen!
Hey, what are you doing here?
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
It's okay, Stephen, I --
When dad died, I saw another fire...
How do you know?
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
Hey.
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
Hi.
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
Okay.
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
Brian. What's wrong?
I was doing my job.
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?
You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
Who the fuck is doing this?
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.
Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.
Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.
Did you pull me out?
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
Completely out of control.
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
Where's Sean?
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
He treats you okay?
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
Yeah? When was the last time?
I'm working on it.
...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
You don't know... nobody knows...
It knows us. This one knows us.
Alderman Swayzak.
It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's -- it's someone who wants to kill me.  You gotta believe me!
So what are you doing here?
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
I forgive you.
Oh, really?
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.
My name is Honeycutt and I want to try something different.  Can you do this for me?
C'mon.  It's easy.  It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word.  Everybody go it?
I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.
Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
I'm not smiling.
Certified ladies' man, huh?
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
Please, have a seat.
I'm out.
You can walk away.  We both can.
No offense.
I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.
I'm starvin' like Marvin.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street.
DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind.
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
Do you know what C.P. Time is?
That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.
We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
That's a great handle.
Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on.
Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!
This has to be a big mistake.
Good woman.  I trained her right.
How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
Same here.
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.
This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in.  Could Don King be near?  Good thing Sloan had my back.  She's my rock.  This was going to be a whole lot of work.
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
Mantan, we got a show to tape.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
How's the food?
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
Richmond is not all the way down south.
Regardless, he still is your father.
No.
You know how your Daddy is.
Finland.
Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?
The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't it?  Number One.  We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras.  Two. Let the audience decide.  Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four.  Who determines what is black? Five.  Mantan is a satire.  Six. If they can't take a joke, "F" 'em.
Yes you!
I never had a really real pair before.
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
Around...
...then what about...
Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
I feel a song a comin' on.
A lot?
This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny.
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
You're sure this is a good idea.
Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass.
Sir, I'm a British officer.
Has he sent the challenge yet?
I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?
Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
For whom else have you worked?
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
Not one.
It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
How so?
Will we always leave it at this?
I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:
I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
All the same, you must name an amount.
Was he cheated?
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.
Yes, he's fine.
Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at me.  Marriage has added forty years to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty.  When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself.  Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable.  Take a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps.  Do anything, but marry.
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
Sir, let those laugh that win.
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
Can I at least have a drink?
Yeah, if you've slept.
Hurricane kept you up, too?
Bill Styles...
Don't you ever point a gun at me!
You framed-him...
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --
Why not?
That'd be my reaction too --
So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --
And he'd been shot.
You saved Kendall's life --
What business?
Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?
What the fuck is going on?
He wouldn't kill anybody...
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
What do you mean, West's?
Where have you been, Jay?
You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
Why... why didn't you tell me?
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first...
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.
He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one.
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
Why?
A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --
Yeah.
You think you could explain all this to me?
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you.
The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, you're a murderer --
You're off to a late start.
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
That was kid gloves?
I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.
Dunbar.
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
What?
That's a fantastic idea --
I pushed him too hard.
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.
Hardy, what are you doing --
We need to talk --
How?
I don't think I want to hear this --
Pike and I got separated --
We just want --
No one else heard it?
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
Who, Levi --
What the fuck happened to you --
Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first --
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
Tell him to shut up --
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
He's not Army, it's not official --
You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.
You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Great, great. That's fantastic.
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
What do you mean? You don't even know me.
I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.
Didn't kill anything, did I?
You won't find a better place!
Fine, you do it.
You get the eye?
Can I see him?
Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.
How long have you known my father?
How would you describe him?
How old are you?
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
Promise me you'll come back.
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
Helping people makes me happy.
It's okay, just leave it.
Spooning the sherbet.
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
Karl.
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
You --  -- are in for a surprise.
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
I thought you weren't dying.
Why not religion, Dad?
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
Let's get out of here.
It's unbelievable.
Daffodils?
How did you get so many?
You don't even know me.
How can I convince you to stop?
Wait! I need those!
This is why you don't show work in progress.
It's me. Norther Winslow.
I don't believe it!
Oh. Oh.
How did you know my father?
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
Do you love your father?
Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.
Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
You first.
Hello.
Yes. I know.
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
I...
You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.
I understand. I'm so sorry
Just leave her alone.
So. Is it different to how you imagined it?
Syevodnya?
"Frenzy".
So what are you going to do?
I do. I want to very badly.
What?
Shut up. I'm not listening.
We'll pretend it never happened.
I don't hate you.
And who says what is wrong.
What?
You are throwing me out.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
I've got news for you. It's not working.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
Okay. Goodbye.
What does it mean?
Is the flight full?
How do you want to pay?
What are you doing?
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
Angela?
Is your niece older than 12?
I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
More cough syrup?
Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow?
Still need a lift?
Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
Jes? Jesse?  Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP!
Nothing's gonna happen. Not like everybody over there is in the line of fire with them Arabs blowin' themselves up.
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
Rose. Folks get sick. But you do what you can to get on the mend. Our marriage... it just got sick. That's all.
Better than what you give.
God forgive you, for how you done me...
My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.
YOU SHUT UP!
Or what? OR WHAT?
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
Let me say somethin' first...
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
Gal, you ain't right yet.
My God, gal, don't you got no SENSE? I ain't sayin' I ain't weak? Shit. Playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you!  I GOT SIN IN ME! I AIN'T GO'N LIE! BUT I GOT RESPECT! AND ALL YOU GOT IS BILE, GAL!
Want another?
I don't want you to let go.
See, that girl is in my favor. You heard me, nigga? You fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit.
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
It got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. Got fresh 22's on her. Ain't my doin'. That's just how it came to me. Don't worry. Nobody gonna come lookin' for it. I got the pinks... got no problem.  Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus.
That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
Then what?
The hell is this shit?
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick.
What?
I feel better. Do you?
Ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore? Gill told me. Told me how you and he... you and everybody...
Didn't know you was workin' here now?
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
What are they doing now?
Who do you think the Jap is?
Some party.
... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
What'd you say?
Nick... You up?
I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.
I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
Joyce can be nice.
Are you expecting anyone?
Nick!
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
What'd I tell you?
Did I say that?
Nick...
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
Because he knows how to get to our man.
It's illegal, Nick.
Nick, you can't do this.
Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
How many men?
Thank you.  You have one?
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs.
I need your help, Joyce.
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
This is my stop.
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!
We're police officers.
-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.
Seven years work by the finest engraver.  Mass produced, sequentially numbered.  The best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.
That wasn't our deal.
Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.
What's the problem?
But not to last.
Also you're too valuable to experiment with.
I've done some questionable things.
Why are you staring at us?
You're our best and only friend.
You got a machine on it yet?
Yeah.
I was just about to have my dinner.
Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.
When might that be?
Okay, but...
Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females.
Prosit.
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
Let's hear it.
Nerves of steel.
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
You sure?
Taffey Lewis?
I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.
You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?
What shows?
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
In your opinion.
I can imagine.
You ever take a bath with a man before?
When was the last time you cleaned this place?
Have you ever known anybody a long time?
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.
Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
Already had I.Q. test this year -- but I don't think I never had a...
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
Know what a turtle is?
But I understand what you mean.
You want to go home?
Where are your folks?
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
Your mom was a dancer?
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
Well, that depends...
Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
What's wrong with you?
Do you own a car?
Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!
How's that?
That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.
Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
See, ya.
What?
Why not go to work for me?
What's fair?
Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!
It does?
When do you need her by?
Get out!
Stop that ma'am crap!
Never drive again!
Yes!
Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
The guy with the underpants!
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!
Hey, Eve!
No it's not!
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
That's ridiculous.
You wanted to see me!
I'm leaving, too.
I'm really sorry!
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
There.
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise.
No.
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.
A card?
That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...
These are wonderful.
The nocturnal flying mammal?
Oh, boy! A jacket!
Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
But, I don't understand.
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
You're sure?
You have very nice ceilings.
Who use to own it?
This must be very new.
No.
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
You bet!
Bye, Troy!
The sky?  Where?
I don't see anything!
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
Oh, that would be wonderful!
Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
Days??
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
Calvin!
One who doesn't glow in the dark.
Let's eat our cake.
Should we say a little prayer first?
I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
You came back for these?
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
Well, what do you think?
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
That water's freezing!
Just be yourself.
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
He go back to the hotel?
In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days.
Or have perfect table manners.
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
Oh, no!
An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Not yet.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
Shit. You better tell me something.
THEN WHAT?
Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.
Yes.
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
No. What is happening?
Hi, can I come in?
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
Who is Don?
Yes.
No. I should go.
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.
Come on Dorothy.
Do you love me?
I asked first.
You what?
I'll call you.
They hurt his head.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
MOMMY!
Can I feel 'em?
On a ride.
Heineken.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
Nothing. I'm fine.
He comes over to study.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
Oh yeah?
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
What happened to him?
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
OK.
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
You saw a lot in one night.
You were late.
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
Oh yeah?
Jeffrey!!
You like mysteries that much?
Okay.
NO.
My father has a gun at home.
Dorothy!... Dorothy!
I should go with her, Sandy.
I don't know why we have to watch TV.
What did he bring him in for?
Just for him?
Up where?
Hey, I just...
There's ways around that.
Are ya ready?
Yes sir.
Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.
Donna's gonna be angry about her cat.
You think they sold me out? No way.
Anybody see ya?
Oh man. You gotta let me do these guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make up for the tit thing.
Shit.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
How's Uncle Sibeal?
Yeah, we promise.
Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.
Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?
"What do we tell him about the guns and money?"
I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and talked.
Destroy all that which is evil...
I'm serious.
Where the fuck are you going?
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Now, you will receive us.
We do not want your tired and sick.
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
They were wearing masks.
The what man?
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
The Greeks. The Italians.
Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
Chief, what the fuck is this?
He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?
How many bodies, Greenly?
Uh.  Shit, I, uh...
What if it was just one guy with six guns?
Fuck you!
Hello?
Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man!
Liberating isn't it?
Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.
Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
You bet your ass he will.
We'll keep going, Roc.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
Forgive me father.
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
Continue the joke.
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
What color hair does he have?
Making Hutch David Soul?
She's really kind of hot.
Is it back in?
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
Calm down. Take a deep breath.
Yeah.
Can I get that credit card from you?
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
Inez, this is --
Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.
Obviously. That's a given.
He told you and you let him do it.
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
I have an idea for that.
Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us.
I had to give some to Inez.
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
Who's in the car?
Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
OK. Mark that down.
God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry.
He was a nice guy.
I don't know.
He did?
You got to be kidding me.
What'd he get?
Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?
You're living on a sailboat?
Where?
Does it float?
So how is it in there? 
No. I'm not.
This is my business manager, Rowboat.
That's a sharp jacket.
You mean a safecracker?
Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
Did Dignan take the test?
Are you afraid?
This is good.
Where you going?
Anthony, I --
Let's not even talk about it.
Give him a second.
You OK, Bob?
We think Mr. Henry maybe --
Were you born in Mexico?
Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
Where'd they come from?
Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack?
If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
What was that all about?
You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
What are you doing?
What happened?
Did we get it?
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember you!"
In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten?
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
This could be a trap.
Not in that car you're not.
Give me the keys, Dignan.
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.
Do they let you --
Wait a second --
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.
Is he in?
What do you mean grammar?
Is he good?
Join the party, fellas.
Where did he go?
Where?
You a good pool player.
Come on in!
The world needs dreamers, son.
...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
Excuse me.
May I finish?
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now!
Because you're afraid!
I emptied it.
-- car keys?
-- what? --
Where were you, Jason? In the car.
I'll get the book.
-- it hasn't been two years --
We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
It's just a nightmare.
Sleep. Sleep now.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
...but you're not -- you're not sure...
You drive.
Say it.
Abbott?
So when was I here?
What do you want?
Okay, how do you want to do it?
Don't need it. I remember everything.
-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
Mr. Nevins?
I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??
Amnesia?
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.
I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
Wallace has sacked York!
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.
The Bruce is not coming, William.
Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.
That's just a dream, William!
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
They're English soldiers, ain't they?
I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
Where is my son?
My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.
You've been here before?
Did it work?
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.
You have... you have a husband.
You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?
Fine speech. Now what do we do?
I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first.
And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
I don't know. These things take time.
What does that mean for Evan?
Just. Like. Jason.
Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.
You really think he wanted to kill you?
Get out. Both of you.
Ouch.
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
So how's Tommy?
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?
It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
Are you okay?
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
I was?
And...?
Then you think it might have worked out?
We're really gonna be in a movie!?
What's happened to -- How are you doing that?
Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.
Smells like sex in here.
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
Lenny? Come on!
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
I should have known.
Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
Yes, I'll bet.
Does he know that?
And you want to know --
Go back to Bulgaria.
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.
Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?
Yes, I come.
I'd better be going.
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.
Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.
My German's a little rusty.
That's too far ahead to plan.
Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
I didn't count the days.
Can I tell you a story, Rick?
Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
Put them on the table.
For the last time, put them on the table.
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
Yes.
It's been a long time.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
You are very kind.
Goodnight.
Our faithful friend is still there.
Ask me?
No, Victor, there isn't.
Rick? Who's he?
Good morning.
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!
I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
And that is?
You will give us the names?
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
Mademoiselle.
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?
You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.
Victor Laszlo.
Manages what?
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
Oh, it's my party.
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
I have. Sit down over there.
Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while. There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville. I could be induced to arrange a passage.
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
Huh. You know, Rick, watching you just now with the Deutsches Bank, one would think you'd been doing this all your life.
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
Boss, let's get out of here.
What's that you're playing?
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
You played it for her and you can play it for me.
Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.
Do too little you'll die.
If they can't see you, what's the point?
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
I float.  You sink.  End of story.
What's so damn funny?
Jesus.
Oh?  You've tried?
Got to follow the paper path here.
Chuck.
Merry Christmas eve.
I can't even keep fish alive.
I have to.
I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a little carried away.
What's that?
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
I love you, Chuck.
When's the next Jumbo?
Need some help?
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.
Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account.
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
You fucked us over.
For the third time.
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
How about we go somewhere else?
Cool ropes.
You were how long on this?
To Wilson.
Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.
Permission to come aboard, sir.
It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue...
These *credentials* are against the law!
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
What'd she die of?
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
And what did she die of, exactly?
At least you were never lonely.
You don't miss it?
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?
I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...
How is that Wally doing?
I just wanted to ask you...
Is *your* father dead?
"I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it."
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
"Burma run" because you fly over Burma...
It's almost like flying.
So. What should I do now?
I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
I'm stayin', Homer.
There's more than one laceration, more than one cut.
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
It looks like scurvy.
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
I am not a doctor.
Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
Rose Rose?
What's that?
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.
I'm not in trouble.
Give men that. I know how to do it.
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
They told me I was too old to serve.
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?
It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at.
I told him that you all is sick.
That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right.
You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help.
That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
Can --
What's this?
Ten percent. Of how much?
Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.
Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.
Your life flashing before your eyes?
I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.
So much for honor among thieves. You would have cut loose your friends, your girl...
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
So we go to the bar.
Who's that?
Currently, the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses.
Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young. The whole thing took about two and a half hours. That's how good he is.
Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night. They just pulled him out of the East River.
She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.
Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.
You'll be there?
Jake --
So that's it...
Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?
Minus one.
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once.
What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.
Look at you, you skinny prick.
Come here. Feel this.
Come on. Harder.
Don't get me wrong, Jake. I like you boys. You guys are the steadiest business in town. But what can I say? Twenty percent's still better than what we give to any of the other criminals.
Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.
Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. Could you..?
Oh Jesus!
What -- What do we do?
Says who?
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
What about Customs?
What the hell's his problem?
And some new clothes.
He's gone.
You just put a mother of a jinx on us.
Look at you... You want to go.
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him.  What the hell was his name?
What about...
What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee? Because it is all about the money, right?
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
Is it all fugasi?
So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, "You're fired! Your whole team's fired!" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo --
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
Stand up.
What happened?
Sorry. What?
Special Agent?
Peace of mind.
Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.
It's just insurance.
I'm Bella.
What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
What?!
I thought it was you. It's the hair!
Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here...  It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business.  Bring a friend. I've plenty of room.
I found her in bed with someone.
I don't gamble.
Where did you get it?
In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer.
How did it go?
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
The door, Jack.
It's beautiful. Thank you.
You're entitled to your opinion.
Really?
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
No.
Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice...
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room.
I'm in trouble.
They mean it.
The point is, they want a man inside.
But if it does.
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
Is it yes?
Yes.
How are you?
You've been avoiding me.
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
She's my baby.
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
Does Bella come here?
I can't give you a lift back tonight.
There are three types of casino in the U.K. High volume. Small faction. And MOTR. That's middle of the road. Us.
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
Ever?
You can start Monday week.
That hair will have to go.
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.
I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.
Where is it? What did you do with it?
Where is the key?
Fuck that shit.
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Quantum is up thirty-five.
Rechannel all safety relays --
One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?
It is intuitively obvious.
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
Exactly.
That's it.
Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
So if you detonate in...
-- automatic channels open --
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is.
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
Doolittle! Help me.
Looks like I'm headed for the planet, Talby. Going right toward it.
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
That's correct, sir.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
Sir?
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
Men... men... what happened, men?
Who are you?
You're attractive, you're smart.  Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do--
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take offense to that?
Lemme put some clothes on.
Out there.
Which is none of your business...or mine.
Where'd you clip this?
I'll make it worth your while.
So Max, what do you do with all your money?
He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--
What else can we do?
Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice...
I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.
Sorry about your window.
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
Is the social studies class over for today?
How do I know you didn't?
Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are a whack-job.
Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
I'm sorry.
What's this?
You are involved.  By being alive you're involved.
Know where I can find her?
Who is it?
This is not a place you wanna go.
Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...
Say the words, "I understand."
Thank you.
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
That's odd...
Tell me the truth.  Am I a female fog bank?
Yeah.
A long time.
Gotta go.
Only one I can think of.
Can you put that in a bag or something?
Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
Catch you back at the wall.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
Really?
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
A toy?
She tells you how I've been--
Okay, okay, okay--
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
What about this?
Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?
Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me.
Sorry.
So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? Y'know, to make it so long?
Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?
So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
What was that D.J.'s name again?
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
I found the Volvo.
No... You don't think...?
Are you gettin' wise with me?
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
Jam, listen up.
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?
Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.
I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.
I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!
Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella.
Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...
Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
Beg pardon?
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
"The Last Unicorn!" By Samantha Darko.
Dea ex machina...
You have a request?
Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?
You're weird.
That was a compliment.
So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
Well...
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?
No. Frank.
I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
You're such a fuck-ass.
He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?
You're my only son...
And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.
What is her name?
Do you think a lot about girls?
Who is the boss?
I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?
Whoa.  That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
Then how is time travel possible?
When will this happen?
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
If that's what you think is necessary.
Rose.
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
You-betcha.
Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
Loretta, don't do that.
Amber...
Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I -- I'm not goin' through this again.
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
What're you doin' here?
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
Here, I didn't get any.
Well, uh, I'm cuttin' out early today to do a little duck huntin'... but, uh, maybe I could call you tonight.
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber.
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
You don't know where this is gonna...
We was robbed.
That bitch from...
Wisconsin.
Do you think that most people would say that teenage beauty pageants are a good idea?
And the year before that?
...Oh, yeah-right. I ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! Look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.
Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
Oh! What is it?
So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
What!
Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?"
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.
I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
Go out and chase that peanut vendor away from the building -- Get rid of him if you have to use violence - if necessary call out the militia and if he isn't looking get me a bag of peanuts.
Who to?
Yes -- why?
Hey you!!
Have you got a license?
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
You know, I'd be lost without a telephone.  Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary of War.  The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy it from me and I get 10% commission.
My card.
Late again, eh?  You haven't been on time once since this war started...  Get out there and fight... 
How'm I doing, boss?
If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
I shall dance for you tonight as I've never danced before.
That's even a greater honor.
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
Give me that again!
Oh -- you mean... worm?
Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is an outrage!  This man is impossible... My course is clear...  this means war...  You RUNT!
What'll I do with this card?
Your Excellency!
Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you.  Notables from every land are gathered here in your honor --  This is a gala day for us.
You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see you have an open mind.
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
Oh, won't you reconsider...
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!
So that's the one you want to marry.
They have noble faces.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
Did it go well, darling?
Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?
I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
I found it.
Never mind that, I want my man!
Now I think we really do understand one another.
A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.
Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
Oh yes?
How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it.
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
Don't we?
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
You never mentioned his mental state.
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
Romance!
John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick.
Mmmerrick.
...Yes potatoes... but...
John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
The children! May I see?
Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time...
No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you.
You want a dressing bag, John?
Mr. Treves! Treves.
Stand up, John. Let them see you.
Won't come out, eh?
Watery headed bunch.
I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
It's all right! It isn't happening!
It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
Please! Please! What are those?
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
Halfdan the Black.
Just give me a hand.
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
I'll tell you what...
You don't know Halfdan the Black.
But it IS! Look!
I don't suppose... no...
I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
You told them I raped you -- why?
FIND the Rainbow Bridge?
It's Halfdan the Black!
It's not magic! It's just a trick!
I want to die...  No, I don't!
Faster!
What did he say?
You mean we'd be dead?
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
A magic dishcloth.
No! Let go, Snorri!
You need to say a bit more than that!
Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.
But HOW?
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
What's all the panic about?
It can't do you any HARM...
Vanish into thin air?
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
You're wasting your time.
Same thing, isn't it?
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
Let me go, Sven.
I'm not worth risking your life for.
Who's that?
Get away, Snorri.
Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.
You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it.
Can't make enough axe-heads!
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
So did my father and his father before him.
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
And keep your sword greased.
I don't know, honey. It's horrible.
Yeah.
Shit. The last time I saw you.
How are you today?
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
Oh, baby, what's going on?
I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
I'm sorry.
Really?
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
I like it.
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
I'm sure you would.
Oh, I doubt that's the case.
Huckleberry Hound?
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
It's okay.
Yeah.
Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.
Um --
You like that?
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
You should stay.
Yeah.
Tomorrow?
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.
I want to know you.
Joely...
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
What if you hide me?
You remember what happened next?
There's this guy!
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
Joel!
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
I had you pegged, didn't I?
Hi there.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
Oh God, how horrid.
What do we do?
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
Listen, did you want to make love?
Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
What took you so long?
Yeah?
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
That's me.
I might be making a mistake.
Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...
She's so sexy.
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
What? What do you mean?
How was it?
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
Stan... c'mon...
It's just... y'know... I mean...
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
It's stopped.
I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...
No way. I can handle this.
I swear.
I really like you, Mary. You know that.
You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.
What do you want, Stan?
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
Howard, your one o'clock.
Thanks.
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.
The voltage looks fine.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night.
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains.
I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly?
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
Why? Why do you have to go?
Going north?
Whooee!
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?
Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?
Holy shit...
The containment, Second Containment...
...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.
It's holding... She's holding...!
Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
What's happening?
I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
How is he?
He'll live... if we ever make it back.
Please... kill...
What's happening...?
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
What does?
...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
I found one.
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.
Yes.
I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
What about it?
Explanation?
We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it.
To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
What are you talking about?
You can't have them. Go to hell.
Jesus...
We've got some weather.
Do we have enough time for a weld?
Skipper...
Smith, get out of there...
We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.
Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
It tastes bad.
Oxygen is not the problem.
You've got to listen...
I'm on my way, Starck.
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
I'll do it --
He served on the Goliath.
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
Can you see a body?
No. I saw nothing.
Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.
Almost got it.
Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what have you. That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment area. Can we move in closer?
30 hours to Neptune orbit.
You can't do that.
This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon, Event Horizon, do you read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing... 
Miller, do you read me, Peters --
What are you doing?
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
We're going to have to work on your touch.
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
What about his first born?
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
The shields on the station should protect us.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
You're on fire!
Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields.
Now what is up with that?
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
Back it down, Johnny!
Apparently I can disappear.
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've got to do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side.
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
What are you doing here?
What's going on?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill.
Easy, mon.
Come on, Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that!
Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is?  What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over.  So who do you have first period?
Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?
Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.
Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?
Dad says you have to get up!
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone.
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
You're a really good kisser.
What's going on?
Take that back.
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
I would. Yeah.
Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.
And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
Damone, are you there?
Hey, Mark. Is that you?
If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
Are you Linda Barrett?
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
So what did you do?
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
Well I never did it.
What's Doug do in Chicago?
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
I paid for it and everything.
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
Where's Doug?
Not coming? What happened?
Dartmouth?!
Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
Do you want to sit there, Jeff?
Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
Thanks for coming to get me.
Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
Where's Mike today?
I made a fool of myself.
Hi, Mark.
Really?
Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
There's no hurry! The race is over!
Let's have lunch!
Killed?
Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California.
What happened? What did they do to her?
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
He wanted the pineal gland.
I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one?  How about some ether?
"One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."
God hell! I think I see the pattern! This one sounds like real trouble! You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over. As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts...  This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you -- and we'll have to arm ourselves.
Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
Can we make it?
Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!
Fuck yes. I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it.
Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible.
NO! Stop talking like that.
The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. But, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: My attorney.
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!
The airport is over there!
No! I can't get out! They'll crucify me. I'll have to take the blame!
Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.
May I see your license.
Could I have that, please?
You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
You know where it is?
IS IT CLEAR?!
I don't think you should...
We shot a skunk.
Hey! Get quiet or get out.
You got something better?
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
You seem mighty collected about this.
What now, Geronimo?
How are you holding up?
Will I go crazy or something?
What do you mean what?
What's it for!?
Nine?
You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy.
Clever fuckers.
NO, but I will lock you in.
Shit!
You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.
OH JESUS!
Let's move.
DON'T!
Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming, baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming!
Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never, ever, never let you go.
Her name is Charlie.
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
Did we make it?
What did we say about lying?
Frances?  Oh no.
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
Excuse me, sir?
Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.
Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
A rich actress.
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
We're all square now, Harry. Right?
No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
This is the answer: a subscription drive to "Voice of Action!" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski!
An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
Of course.
I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and... 
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
See you next weekend?
Why?
Just one minute...
Harry.
Don't be a rat, Harry.
Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
You don't know what you want.
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
Jesus.
What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
Take a walk, pal.
Evening, gorgeous.
Where are we, mean man?
I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
You know something, Harry?
To quarter-horses.
It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing.
Frances! Frances!
Where to?
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
How... how ya doin', Farmer?
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
That would be okay.
Yeah.
You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady.
I'll pay your way to New York. I'll work, I'll slave. I'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or --
It's okay.
I think I need a little air.
How long will you be?
I'll have lunch ready by one.
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
Normal. Average.
...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit?
I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
Symington says...
And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family?
Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?
I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
And he drove me to mine.
Nice.
It can't be as bad as that.
I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful
In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
Are you sure it can't hurt us?
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
I've loved you all my life
This feels... incestuous.
I wish to be your wife.
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
Our decision. Together.
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
A warming wind.
I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
I was just clearing my throat.
I am not mad.
Only you would think of that!
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
They just caught the man who did it.
Yes? And?
We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
What happened up there?
I have always loved him.
In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse.  Any questions?
Philosophical?
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.
You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you.
Do you share my madness?
Shows how much you know. It's something about tomorrow.
You draw very well.
What'll you do when you leave here?
How come?
I'm sorry.
You said we were special.
You know what I said, though.
I wouldn't know.
Let's go back, Barry...
Give me a hand?
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
I'll be okay. Holy shit...
You saved my life.
It's gonna be a long summer.
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
It's just a dream.
Mmmmmmmph?
Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
It's beautiful...
You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.
I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word.
Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.
What is your purpose in Mexico?
Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?
We got about two more hours of day light left. That'll get us into El Paso, which is right next to the border. We'll stop at a motel --
Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions.
Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
Why did they block the door again?
What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Not a chance.
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
Where is the little lady?
She's dead?
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
Didn't like it, did ya?
I'm telling you, don't hurt her.
We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico. Now it's time for your part, letting us go.
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
What are you going to do?
Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.
Now, is your shit together?
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
Did he...?
It's the bitterest of pills.
That happens, you'll get it back.
There's nothing wrong with this place.
I'm going for 'em!
Yeah.
Should I use the last bullets on us?
I'm sorry.
-- see this, television!
Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
I never said help us!
What the fuck was that about?
Richie? You okay?
Do they have cable?
Hey, when you talk to him, see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent.
This isn't gonna work.
What does that mean?
You just called me a fuckin' nut.
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
Far out.  Where are my glasses?
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
That's what you think?
How?
What do you mean?
Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us?
How 'bout you?  You are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican border town all night long. Just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along fine.  Scotty, you sure you don't want a drink?
They take you away to San Clemente Island.  Half the guys quit when they come back.  Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.
I don't know if there's any single reason.  But my father was Navy. And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den.  It showed a girl trying on a sailor's uniform while saying, "Gee, I wish I were a man! I'd join the Navy!"  Was maybe 10 years old when I first saw it, and even then it felt wrong.  Made me mad.  And I don't think a month has gone by that I haven't thought about that poster.  "Gee, I wish I were a man."
Administration, Ensign Blondell.
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
Yes, of course.  Please, have a seat, lieutenant...
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
Well.  'Least now we're talking the same language.  So one standard.  Is that what you're after?
Straight up?
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'.
Ah, c'mon...
I ain't gonna shoot her.
What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?
Think I overplayed it?
She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
"The Lark Report."
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
You don't know that.
What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
I once promised you a fast ticket, Jordan, and I always meant to make good on that.  Come work for me.  I can always use a hard-charger on my team.
Then I suggest we start there.
What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder?
Montgomery, why do they call you "Flea"?
Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me.  But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  It's just gonna hurt us both, okay?
Hey.  You okay, Flea?
Close as I can get, el-tee!
O'Neil?
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
Do we know it's him using the beacon?  Not a decoy?
Unless you Whiskey Run.
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
I've been trying you for five days. Don't they give you messages?
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me.
Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one year -- your year.  That sound right?
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
They're more afraid of you.
If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area.  Now how smart is that?
'Cool?
Say again, sir?
Any brothers?  Sisters?
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --
Well, I'm trying to figure out if you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous -- or some new alloy of all three.
Well, who the shit you think you are?  Comin' in here like that?
Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there.
You don't suppose this is just part of...
Thought you two were file-closed.
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
I take it this file is still open.
I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks...
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
Who the hell are all these people?
Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
That why you dumped him?
How long where you and dis guy goin' steady?
Don't you think we have enough?
You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.
Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?
...he's pregnant.
You never said it was off the record.
What are you doing here?
Circuits are overloaded.
Are you okay?
You'd be surprised.
And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.
I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
Did Romeo have a name?
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
Hey, do you have any glue in your bag?
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
I can't.
Hence the radiation.
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
Merde!
They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.
They didn't make it.
Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.
That is our job.
You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
Look, I may work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills are not my field.
But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
Do I know you?
Here. 23rd street subway station. Where we first found the fish. With a little luck, this will lead us right to it.
What's with the chewing gum?
I think we should leave now.
Contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape.
What'd they say?
Who the hell are you?
Hello?
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
God, what an ass.
About this much.
Go ahead!
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
He's a twit!
Settle down, Alex...
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
And note the sucked in gut.
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
Those blue things ate everybody here?
Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
He dissed us AGAIN, Brandon!
Hi Brandon.
Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
Go. They're off again.
I just can't believe it. Any of it!  Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven.  Oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  Computer?
What's the weather like outside?
No, I'll kill you. .
...The digital conveyor.
It's suicide.
Oh, they're so cute.
Your last name.
We're screwed... We're so screwed...
It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?
~e're alive!
But I'm the Commander!
All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly.
We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
All right... here's the plan:  First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere.  Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.
Jason.. Can you hear me?
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
You should have let me hit him.
We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  Teb, reset the pod, we're going back.
I heard it too.
First, I require the Omega 13... Second-
Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
Yes.
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
We pretend...
Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.
Commander?... Where are you... going?
An interstellar vox.
How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people.
Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.
Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
Sorry Guys... It just went off.
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Continue forward, sir?
Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.
Unfortunately, I'll never get the chance.  I'm leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion.  Wasting my time, naturally... Look at her teasing those bumpkins.
We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we have an army yet?  What is happening?
Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that?  After all you've done, it's unbelievable!
Go on... I want to hear everything.
After visiting Congress I know what it's like being violated by come disproportionate asses!  Ah, if she only knew that the most important men in the country -- possibly the world -- are sitting at this table...
Our plan is to hit them as they leave.
They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats... we desperately need food.
You, you just need a new flint, General.
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?
Wil, I want to remind you of a conversation we started just before Monmouth...
No uniforms.  No coats, even?  In this weather?
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?
Captain Alexander Hamilton, sir!
Excuse me, General, but may I ask how do you feel?
Are you going to keep him, sir?
What are we going to do?
General Greene is here.  There are two other divisions here.
Yessir.
Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?
Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.
With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.
They are... friends of Congress.
No one wants another failure right now, God knows.  But people like Arnold and, God knows, I'm having my fears about General Washington.
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
However, through my relations with members of his majesty's court, I am a representative of the French government whose deepest desire is to be one people, united with our American brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of King George of England.  Vive la France!  Vive l'Amerique!
What is it, Marquis?
Our beloved father, the King, also refuses to bend.
But, as usual, it will not go well for... them.  Martha, you must trust me.
"Liberty, Virtue, Country"... That's from Cato... you know, that play about the noble Romans?  As I was riding up to Philadelphia, I found myself thinking about the old days...
That's right...
Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
A horseshoer?
At one time I could have chosen not to be.
Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
And to think I am teaching you to become one of them...
What are you doing?
I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre.  I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.
For God sake, get that horrid stuff off your face.  You look like a damned slave!  It's damned humiliating.
What is this?
And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
Listen, tonight, later on, I got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. I want you to go have a look around Chili Palmer's hotel room.
What're you hanging around with a guy like that for? You were in the movies, right? A stuntman? What's he ever done he can talk about? You feel okay?
About sixty.
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
Harry called you his associate, but what does that mean? I never heard your name or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
Title's the first thing's got to go. And the guy's name. I mean, even this writer's name, Murray Saffrin is better than "Lovejoy".
There's Ilona.
You know how to write one of these?
I really think I can be of service on this one.
You know Laurel Canyon?
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
She's great. Gimme the money.
How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
Ray Barboni?
Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
Or else what?
Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
You say look at you?
I checked the bag at the airport, when I came.
Your wife a Lakers fan?
Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
A marker's like a check, Harry.
Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying.
You pack a gun?
What does that mean?
Really? You ever been arrested?
You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not?
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -
Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
So how 'bout it, Mr. Selznick, do I make my deal with Bo? Or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him.
Yeah, he told me.
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.
One we're producing.
Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami.
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.
Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
The door from the patio, in back.
No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years.
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
That why you came over here, to ask me that?
A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid.
You sure?
I don't know.
What took you so long?
They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
He already knew it.
Yeah? What three words, Harry?
Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.
I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
Oh, for Christ's sake -
Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.
I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with.
North Island, please repeat? Over.
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Your radio check is affirmative. Over.
Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.
Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.
Maureen.
Last thing we want is extra partners.
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
Dodge.  Dodge.
You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over.
Mother fucker!
The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered.
What's this?
But how long?
Went aboard.
It's a hell of a lot of money.
Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.
If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options.
Bodies're too fresh.
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
That's a good thing?
What'd he look like?
Stay away. Or else.
Headache, nausea, lights?
Sudden flashes of light.
I don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now.
You okay?
Go on.
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
Why not call for help?
What? What the hell're you talking about.
You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
"The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill."
Couldn't sleep.
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.
Over the gold.
What?
Let the buyer beware.
It's funny.
Greer?
Pretty low all around.
Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.
Gettin' a little hot under the collar, I'd say.
We're still drifting.
What about the gold?
What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
No, no. You got leak.
Someone from the past.
Maxine.
Yup.
I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
Pumpkin? What's wrong?
Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh...
Hey... so, what brings you down here?
And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
I'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way I can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds.
What the hell is wrong with you?!
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes.
That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out.
Forget it.
Nothing.
When did I say I hated you?
You must have known all along how I -- you know -- how I felt about you -- it must be totally obvious...  God... I always used to dream about this...
Why not?
Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.
Shut up!
Did you sign up yet?
Maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us.
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
Hi, Al!
Does Oomie really like this show?
So what should we do?
What's going on now? What's he doing?
He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.
That was truly pathetic.
Not really...
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
Just promise you'll do it.
What? How long have you been standing there?
We still have to go in there sometime.
JOSH!
I'll bet he never jerks off...
How about this one?
I totally, totally hate you.
You won't believe it! Guess!
That guy is totally amazing.
You're just jealous.
Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job...
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood...
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
Why? What did he say?
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
Wow... finally.
What about me? Am I not even here?
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid.  I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out...  What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl.
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button.
Do you have any other old records besides these?
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
Punk rock is over!
Hi... what's your name?
Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.
You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.
Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.
Do you have any old Indian records?
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
Those are all 78s... Can you play 78s?
Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --
Oops! I dropped it!
Every guy has a type!
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.
Relax, Seymour, relax...
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!?
Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...
Jesus...
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
For nineteen years...
I promise I'll take good care of it.
What is that?
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
Wow!  What was that all about?
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
Well when can we do something?
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
Uh... I think there's some root beer...
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
What about Joe?
God, Dana's going to kill you!
So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?
Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records?  She could at least have the decency to call me back.
I agree.
I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.  Who is responsible for this?
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
Maybe she's with Josh?
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
What are you talking about?
I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.
The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo-
You've never built in Africa.
I do need to see Starling.
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-
In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off-  -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.
And it worked?
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-
Don't much like them.
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
With much more on the way-  -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground-
Second death? Where?-
Have you got it?
The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers?
Samuel says you killed a lion.
...misfire... it jammed...
Think about something else.
It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.
Good luck.
Why do the workers look unhappy?
Good news?
Soon. 
Why so many?
Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do.  Do I have bad breath or something?
Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
Occasionally
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
No, you didn't, Frank.
His name is Oscar.
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
Good luck.
So this is what you do, huh?
You're really good, you know.
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.
Or we could do that.
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
Maybe I should call Janine.
I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.
I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
That's quite a story.
Who are you going to call?
We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
I command you.
These boys aren't playing around.
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
That's a thousand million electron volts.
The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
Great.  So what are you guys working on?
Who?  Who?  Who?
What's that?
I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to make some headlines with this one.
I'm Ray --
I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find out.
I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.
And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.
Tell him about the toaster.
How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.
Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
Oh, Dana, it's you.
Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
Is that your professional opinion?
There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
I want to help you.
Great rehearsal.
You're the best one in your row.
What's he doing in my refrigerator.
He is the Destructor.
Do you want this body?
I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
Great!  How's it going?
Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?
Yes?
Trust me.  It will be bad.
Of course!  Ivo Shandor,  I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE.  He started a secret society in 1920.
What do you mean by "seen?"
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
I told you it's real.
This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.
Wow!  Does this pole still work?
Ray -- Something's here.
Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
Agile bastard, isn't he?
That's what you told me two days ago!
Don't you think you should at least wave?
How about in the forum.  Right in front of the Senate.
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action...
Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience?
AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
Is this Rome?  Are we just going to be executed?
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.
Servis made it through again?
Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.
You need to come home!
Very fancy.  Did you design the bottle?
Who the hell are you?
Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I won't even get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to get you here.  I know what you're trying to do:  kill yourself and trust in the Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands.  The only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you're a very important individual.  You make me feel good about my investment!  And that puking pig Jerses -- he won't even discuss you.  Both of you have clamped mouths!  But I love all my fighters -- I'll find out about your family.  And about you.  That I promise.
Legate Narcissus Meridas, general of the Spanish Felix Legions!  I'm proud to have you in my school!  Now, show them what you can do!
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
Proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin.
No more bad luck now!  The people are anticipating you!  I have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior -- the true Roman!  The man who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome!
Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?
Are you going to graduate school?
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
Is anything wrong?
Benjamin -- do they know you?
Do you?
And it's all over now.
All right.
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
Why?
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
The marble?
Are you going home?
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
We just can.
I just don't think it would work.
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
Carl who?
How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.
Oh no. He said that.
Are we getting married tomorrow?
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
What are you then?
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
Mr. McCleery?
What for?
Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
Could I make one phone call first?
Well here's the purse.
What?
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
Is anything wrong, sir?
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
Please wait till my husband gets home.
Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
Aren't you?
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
Yes?
Won't you unzip my dress?
What are you so scared of?
But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
Yes, I do.
Hello, Benjamin.
He didn't see me.
Why don't you get it.
Well -- goodbye then --
Would this be easier for you in the dark?
You what?
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Can I take off my clothes now?
Do you really want me to?
Do you want to hear it or not?
What?
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
Well how long has this been going on.
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.
Well I can't.
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
Do you remember the make of the car?
No.
I wish you'd tell me.
Good.
Good.
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
Did I say that?
Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
How?
I don't believe you.
Hello. Get me the police, please.
You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.
Why did you say that?
I do.
You believe me, don't you?
Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
Well --
I don't know. I want it to be --
I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I -- I drove her home.
Here. It looks like you need a refill.
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
Thank you very much, sir.
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
-- before he does --  You're disappointing them, Ben. You're disappointing them.
The Carlsons' are here.
What's happening?
I'm having luck for the first time in my life.
It's a short life and a gay one...
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
Need any help?
No -- no -- no -- no...
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
Reducing?
Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
Too bad.
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
You were very different yesterday.
Why?
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
Oh!
So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
Yes -- tired...
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
Go away. Who are you --?
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
Why do you smile?
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
No?
That's a silly joke.
You do believe that I really love you?
Suzette will be back here any minute.
Why later?
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
Bless you...
I can't.
What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...
I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room.
Hello -- sorry I'm late.
Was the Baron joking, or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits.
What?
If we could scare up some men to play.
Is that too much, Baron?
I've no luck.
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
So that's how we stand, Baron.
Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
Is that for me?
The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. Preysing telephoned.
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
Any letters?
I came here from a long distance to stay at the Grand Hotel. I want a room -- a big room -- like you would give General Director Preysing -- I'm as good as Mr. Preysing -- I can pay like Mr. Preysing -- would you give him a little room, way up in the corner with the hot water pipes going -- bang -- bang -- bang... 
I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
No pain, Mr. Kringelein?
A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes.
You must look at my face and not at the floor.
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
Am I!
How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?
Moreover --
What?
What brown hands you have.
Skiing? 
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
Baron!
Oh, no.
I mean with the Manchester people?
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
Shall I tell them again?
You're a deep one.
Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance.  I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life.  Veronal didn't even help me to sleep. 
I can't dance tonight --
Let us cancel the engagement.
Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- I think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. Last night for instance --
Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
Good morning, Suzette.
Madam has slept well?
Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs.
Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --
Hurry, Suzette.
Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo --
Last night?... There was no applause.
Who are you? -- An embezzler most likely.
Yes, the police must be called.
How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing.
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
Just one moment, sir.
The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference?
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
I can understand that -- after your -- uh --
What do you want with her?
How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
You wanna talk to me straight up?
Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.
You want a drink?
I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.
I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.
Right in front of the room.
Mary Beth, what we have here, uh...
Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money.
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
Yes, yes, but that's --
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
When I said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, I meant for us. I know your record with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive. No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally.
Good to have you back, Roy. I was just looking at --
Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you.  Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too.
Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years?
Well... You're all right now, I guess. I have to get down to the track.
It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.
Not as tough as you, huh?
If you come out to the track, don't know me.
What's that?
Roy, I don't want money from you.
Going somewhere?
I just came back from Phoenix.
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead.
Just a few bucks.
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
What?
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
You don't know what I'd do, Roy. You have no idea. To live.
For God's sake, Lilly!
You're getting off the grift?
If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?
If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it?
Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related?
You heard the shower, didn't you?
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
Roy?
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.
I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through?
She didn't see you, in other words.
Running your broker scam, you mean.
What's that?
That's natural.
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
Sure. Let's get it over.
What?
Ate the gun. Oh.
That's that, then.
That's true, Mr. Simms.
Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush.
Why am I here?
Where?
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms?
The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke.
Where are you going?
He found you, didn't he?
Oh, God... no... not Molly.
You okay?  You seem a little off.
You aced it, didn't you?
BLAAAAAGGGHHHHH!
Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
Is Tim there?
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
What if your parents come home?
Aren't you gonna answer that?
Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
What should I do?
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
Runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in Northern Europe thousands of years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood.  Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic.
What now?!
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.  If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
Yes?
Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
A bitch.
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
Home is important to a man.
I suppose.
How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
I didn't tell you everything.
You know what gets me?
When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.
I'm liable to find anything!
How short the skirts are.
I dunno, boy.
You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
I didn't know we had any women left.
Of course you'll go!  You're going to fly the helicopter.
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
Okay.  Okay.
I know you think that.
I wanted to apologize.
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
Fifty years?
We got to get another pilot.
Gee whiz--
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
Anybody home?
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?
Man and boy.
College!
College?
What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?
Excellent!
"Dad?"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."
We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Why don't you go to bed--son.
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
Play?
Dad?
What's this?
Gee whiz, Dad--
Then speak, by God!  Can you fight with words?
Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish I'd never come home!
Some kind of animal?
What's the matter?
What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
Chow, chow, chow!  God damn it-- nutriment!
Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.
The doctor.
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
A dozen?
He knows you shattered his violin.
See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.
You're begging him to kill you?
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
No.
I'm going to call the police.
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
Help your mother find the bullet.
All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
I feel the same way.  What next?
You have chills?
Pacqualinincheewa root.
You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
Hands and knees, you say?
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
I see.
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
I'm going to shoot you now.
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
It was a bitch.
And you went home unannounced, too?
Dead!
Alice is dead?
Who's dead?
And you, Colonel?  Let me guess: You don't know.
Won't you please join our club? Please?
Something's made you sore.
I feel like I want to yell my head off--just yell anything.  Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!
No.
Oh, Paul--
He's a ghost!
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
A lot of people don't.
I hate that thing.
Yes, he is.
What's his name?
Mom?
What?
What are his symptoms?
Yeah.
We don't have a maid any more.
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
I'm touched.
Did you see him?
The park!
Did you talk to Paul?
Possibly.
A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--
Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.
You know each other?
I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.
Everything's going to be beautiful.
Phooey.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
Start with the smallest weights. Every week add a pound or two.
If he'd just get into scouting, and camp out some, and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire--
You're not exactly the type we're looking for.
I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?
What do you mean?
You want a tip?
That's cool.
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
Man, how many girls do you need?
Are you still going with that fella that teaches at Grand Valley?
It's your money. You talk.
Where's he?
Jesus.
Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?
Is that the way it was with you?
Don't knock it. A girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. Then you're free. You can go off to Europe, meet somebody, get married. My girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. Not me. I'm gonna travel. 'Keep movin' that's my motto.  Would you rather work at Copper Penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? I can make more money suc... doing what I do for five minutes than I can all week at another job.
How important do you think sex is?
He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
They are the same.
I don't blame you, Niki. Really I don't. It's this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex...  ...magazines, music, TV. It's destroying everything. Buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. Kids think it's normal. They think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes...
Granville?
What happened?
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
In G.R.? Why?
This used to be a real city. I was here about fifteen years ago. Embezzlement case. It was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. With a downtown and all.
Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
Where is she?
I bought it at a store in L.A.
Wait. Slow down. A film like this, 16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, sold outright, shown in peep machines, maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible to track. 'Nobody' makes it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees it. It's like it doesn't even exist.
I ain't cheated you, Pilgrim. This is research, damn it! That girl could have told us something.
What are you doing here?
You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
What is it, Jake?
How's your business, Jake?
Jake?
Wes, do me a favor.
Just do what I say. Don't ask.
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
Who told you about this?
Do you have a, ah, film called 'Slave of Love?'
It's a short film.
Here. Take your fifty cents back.
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
Jake.
Sounds all right.
I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
I want to rehire you. To find out what's happening to my brother-in- law.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
Jake'll take care of me.
And what are you studying?
He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec.
Officer, I can explain.
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
Oh. It looks like a hearse.  Very nice. Compact.
Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, of course. What is your name?
Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it.
How about some ginger pie?
What do you think?
Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.
Why not?
Thank you.
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?
Well, I really don't smoke.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
Maude, do you pray?
Want to join me in some cartwheels?
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."
How about some candy floss?
Why are there no photographs in these frames?
Why?
... which I hope will make you very happy.
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
I feel giddy.
Is Sunshine your real name?
Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?
Just give me a rough estimate.
I put a lot of effort into these things.
And a lot of time.
I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for <u>fun</u>? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?
Then why did you leave?
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Stay where you are, Harold .
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
He... he loved me.
It's coming.
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
No bad dreams.
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...
And you're sure it was a woman?
The box. I need the box.
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.
Well... G'bye.
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
What the hell are you asking me for? Tag it. Move it.
Don't get psychic with me.
How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck
You were burned by some organic acid.
This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
If he's here, this is worse than I thought.
Do you believe in hell?
Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
Son. About Rasputin --
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
How does he know so much about me?
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
That voice --
Thank you.
You're kidding --
Down there. Did you ever loose track of him?
Hey, your chili's getting cold --
Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
Hi.
But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
Hello, I'm --
Pardon?
You fucking ass-holes.
What's happening?
Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.
Oh.
Lucky man.
The box... you opened it. We came.
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us.
Let me alone, will you?
Please. Get back into bed.
You were holding onto it like grim death.
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
You remember.
Don't touch me. Or so help me --
Bastard.
I'm brother Frank.
Well can I come in or not?
Julia.
Help me.
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
What happened?
Maybe somebody changed the lock.
How long since you were here?
Not exactly modern.
I thought half of it was your brother's?
No argument.
Larry!
He's here?
What have you done?
Is it deep?
You're done worse.
I'll be down in a minute
Is this upsetting you?
Larry...
This isn't the bedroom.
What's going on?
You're awake. Good girl.
I'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. Keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.
You wouldn't believe me.
Kirsty?
Where are you?
It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?
I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
Are you O.K.?
I guess.
It's like she's waiting for something.
He's gone.
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
No you don't.
Where are you going?
You're not going?
Need any help?
Not that late.
I beg your pardon?
Steve. Thank God you came.
Do I know you?
Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior high...
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
What?
Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet.  Yet.  What does "yet" mean, anyway?  "I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet." What does that mean?  It means you're going to go, doesn't it?
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
Shut the fuck up, Barry.
The band that found me and asked me to join.
Isn't it?
I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
Well what about the new Echo --
What?
She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
May I help you?
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... "Sin City." "New Rose," by The Damned. "Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic. "Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello, Japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... "Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley... And... "Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and the Family Stone.  A bit controversial, I know, but...
Yeah.
Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
Well we rang $900 today.
Can I help you?
What needs sorting out?
I dunno.
You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever.
Hi.
Are you coming home?
But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
I guess it's not that obvious, then.
Did you say something?
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
No problem.  If I can ask one question.
It sounds stupid.
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
So, how are you?
You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.
Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.
I'm sure.
Ray.  I hate Ian.
Don't forget your CDs.
Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
You're soaking.
When are you going back?
What it was like.
Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something. Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.
Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself.  Otherwise, what's the use?
Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
Just local, of course.
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
Very persuasive.
About what?
She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually.
Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
These are worth at least, I don't know --
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?
Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
I warned you.
Happy birthday.
Jesus Christ.
Why not?
I'd rather hear yours.
There was a man once.  Just a simple woodcarver.  But he understood.  More than anyone he could see to the heart of it.  It never ends.  Today is the same as the first.  Tomorrow will be the same as today.  So much time.  And all of it wasted.  You love history?
The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.  Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.
No.  So what now?  We just wait?
It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
I hope I never get that old.
Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.
Sometimes innocents become involved.
What is it you want?
Get out.
I want Taupin.
Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here.
Requiem acer'nam donaei-
Stop.
Aye.
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.
Does it change with me in the room?
Listen to me.  Hear the words.
Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate.
How can I stop such a man?
Impotent cow.
You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez.  We're raised as riders.
You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned.
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
Some think not.
I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
Please not be touching me, Conor.
Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.
Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
Your name?
Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke.
Yeah.
Are you sure?
Where!
The last four.
How did you find me?
And have you something to settle with me?
I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his "heretic stronghold" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich.
I love zoos.  Ever since I was a kid.
The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.
Tradition.
Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.
I want you to come to me.
Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in the country less than a week.  What is your citizenship?
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.
You're one of William's kids, huh?
Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.
Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?
What doing?
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you.  Mervyn, isn't it?
Let him have everything he wants.  Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.  He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay!
I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you.
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
Did you finish the interview?
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail...  I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!
I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.
Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.
Mr. Burns --
Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?
No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office. 
Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted to be sure.
Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.
You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.
What's this?
Done what?
Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
You've got to help me, Hildy.
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
You can't sell me that, Walter.
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.
Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.
Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
Where do you think you're going?
Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!
Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!
Tear into it, will you? Don't sit there like a frozen robin!
Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.
What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
How was that for a tight squeeze?
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
Flip a coin.
Well -- what is it?
Hildy!
And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.
That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.
How about Bruce's?
Hildy, darling!
Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
Who do you want?
You know me. The shirt off my back.
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
He's on my phone. He just called me.
You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?
So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me.
Well, that about covers everything.
Who locked the door?
Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
You guys wanna play some more poker?
So have we!
I'll call.
You ain't gettin' out o' here!
How's everything, Gus?
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
No -- just coffee, Gus.
Same way you did.  Through that gate.
Take your paws off me!
Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
Just one second --
Did you actually give Williams that gun?
I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
What is it?
All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.
Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you.
That's a lie!!
I won't.
Where's the old lady?
Look out, you --
Have you got my dough?
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!
Hiding him where?
Mother!
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
How much do you make a week?
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
For heaven's sake, why not?
Pinkus.
They wouldn't take it.
Here's the picture of my wife.
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
Look out!
Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered --
Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.  Come in, Dave Schwartz.
What's he want?
That was a googly!
Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
What are you doing here? This is our territory
I never was.
Well go on then. You can't join if you can't answer.
That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off.
Tell them about Pauline's mum.
I did see them. I did.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
What's that?
Wow!
Where?
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!
Could you seal it over with hot pitch, Clive? Caulk it like the hull of a ship.
Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.
You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.
You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs.
So you're going to be a grandfather.
Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.
I can't do it. What's the point?
Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
God, how I hate all this scrimping and squalor.
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.
I agree.
Ma, Tiny's in.
How much further?
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.
No! He's one of God's creatures, he can't help it if he's dumb... I'm just crazy about animals.
Wondering what?
He walks, duh.
You all having a Halloween party tonight?
No, really.
You mean John Wayne?
She's pretty cute.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
That reminds me of a film I saw once of a guy who got out of his car at Lion Country Safari to take a picture of a lion cub and got eaten by the lions.
What was that?
Honk at him. Scare him.
Just grin and bear it.
Should we stop?
Well, I got some bad news and some bad news.
I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
Check this out.
This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.
How much is a person supposed to stand?
How's about you give me those same directions.
Christ, ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat.
Ya hear me? You bust that crapper and I'll beat your ass.
Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone?
You sure you don't need any help in there?
This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
Ugh, what's that smell?
Why?
Yeah?
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
You gotta be kidding me. This chick is wasted.
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
That was good babe, just keep doing that.
Rise and shine.
I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.
Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway.
Recover any bodies?
Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.
That's the understatement of the year.
So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love.
Just back up.
I'll go. It's my fault.
Think... do any of these kids look familiar in any way?
Get in... now!
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
What about the body you found?
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.
Harold! Tell the boy again.
Lila, what are you doing in there? I need to get ready for my date.
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
Let's go eat, I'm starved.
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
What is it?
You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.
Call you back.  You bastard! What do you want?
Please. Just one minute of your time.
What?
That's not how he tells it.
I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan.
Yeah?
I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
As do I.
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded.
It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans.
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
You do?
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!
You'll catch cold. It's cold.  What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
What are you doing in there?
Who is it?
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.
Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.
It would just be helpful to know.
Do you like my new look?
I'm trying, you know.  I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.
Really?
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
You just have to control it. We're not apes.
I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
Aha! Finally. I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.
I bow to your expertise in these matters.
Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.
Extra dessert?
Puff, put the gun down.
I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
Mother?
Yes.
Thanks. Sure is a hot day for driving. Late afternoon is better. You guys have plenty of time. Make Pittsburgh in two, maybe three hours.
I'm ready.
To win.
For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
Are you ready for another?
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
That seems a shame. The night is young.
Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
Only when I work.
You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?
See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?
Eddie, you're a born loser.
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
For me.
How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
What's that supposed to mean?
Fine.
You know, that's real sweet music in there. You can almost smell the action and the money. You know, I can feel it right down in the bottom of my shoes.
What's the matter? What happened?
Well, we won't.
I'll beat him the next game.
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
I can beat him, Bert. Now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. I didn't think he did. But I can outplay him. I can beat him.
I wanna walk.
I got time, Bert.
So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
He's my partner.
Why?
Well... well, now.
How do you feel?
Twenty-five hours, Eddie. Twenty- five hours you been playin' straight.
Go to hell.
What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
Oh yeah? Where?
HOW MUCH?!
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
I'll bet you do, Mr. Felson. I'll just bet you do.
I thought we came here to play pool.
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
What's the limit?
Gimme ten bucks.
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
Long wait for a bus?
Fifth of scotch?
Oh, you need a shave. You mustn't go looking like that. There's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. Compliments of the house.
Don't you ever cook anything?
Eddie, what's in that case?
You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?
Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.
Well, what's so funny?
What is it, Eddie?
What do you want to tell me?
Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
Fifty-seven.
Don't wear a mask, Eddie. You don't have to.  That's Turk, Eddie, the man who broke your thumbs. Only he's not going to break your thumbs. He'll break your heart, your guts. And for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what you are. 'Cause of what you have and he hasn't.
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.
...you shoot a great game of pool.
What about... now?
When you're here, in the city, where do you live?
Do you remember where it is?
Mine.
Yes.
That's who you are too, Emma.
You want me to stay?
Emma...
Shhh... don't talk.
That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
You and that damned garden.
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
So, what do you do?
There are more this year than last.
... and Rigel.
... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.
What happened to you?  Who was that?
We were having a little talk.
This is a new town for you.  Do you like it here?
Why?
Jimmy, calm down!  What happened? Tell me what happened!
This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
George, where have you been?
Your father asked you a question.
Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
Better be. You left me for him.
He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you two.
Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?
Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely...
What're you talking about?
Tell her to get the kids and leave town.
What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
Spunky?
It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
This I can see.
What're you doing?
We're loose!
General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can.
How're we doing?
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
With their shields down it might be possible.
Really? You don't mind?
You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
Dick-weed!
You're late.
You scared the hell out of me.
Your son.
Oh. Sorry.
I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?
But I gave you some this morning.
What the hell's going on?
Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.
See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. The last twenty four hours have been really exciting!
What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
My reputation precedes me.
Your treat.
That doesn't look much like a library.
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
Where did this come from?
Let me tell you another "bedtime story," Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.
We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.
DONOVAN!
Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?
Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
Fraulein -- will you permit me?
Except he's lost, and I'm not.
It must be one of these...
Uh-huh.
You came back for the book? Why?
Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.
Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you.
Oh, it breaks the heart.
No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
Through the library?
Found it.
Well, what was left of him.
You did!!
No! Don't Shoot!
How did you she was a Nazi?
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
This is intolerable!
You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
What did you get?
When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.
You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
Well... I can't think of anything.
Dad, are we hit?!
This is intolerable!
What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
Dad?
I like Indiana.
I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.
Get that camel out of the way!
Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.
They will escort you to your rooms now. You will be provided with fresh clothes. Tonight you will be dining with His Highness.
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
We'd appreciate it if the Maharajah would let us stay tonight. We'll be on out way in the morning.
I had a question, Mr. Prime Minister. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts.
Their stories are just fear and folklore.
There, you see, Captain. A rock!
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
Now what about the antidote, Lao.
Indy, look!
What you look at, Indy?
You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones.
It is why Krishna brought you here.
Was the stone very smooth?  It was probably brought here from a sacred river.
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!
You all right?
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
And then they took their children.
What?!
By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai?
Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...
Primitive sexual practices?
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
WILLIE?!
There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
A fulcrum release lever!
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
It's okay. You're all right now.
I want to go home...
Anymore ideas...?
I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
Try me.
I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
Al.
Who are you?
Yeah...Who?
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
I'll tell you what to say.
What do I do?
I wouldn't say that.
Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.
Why? AL  You know too much.
I don't know...To get Al.
Ever think of what they might have to do to find me?
Just walk down the hall?
Corridor A.
Anything...A feeling...a smell..?
What about money?
I'll get in trouble.
It's just not enough.
Eating sushi?
Do you notice anything.
Swim.
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.
Beautiful!
This must be business, there's nothing else here.
What is it?
She doesn't seem to understand.
Wait.
...Joe.
It worked.
I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
Yeah. I did it.
Now, where would I be?
What is it?
Follow that busboy.
They're all in it.
What is it, your charm?
What is it?
You been had. We have.
Bingo.
Better. I found Ryuji.
Osaka.
Where are you going?
One of your instincts?
Don't touch a thing.
What next!
Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
I don't trust her.
It's him.
Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
Then, why'd he lead us here.
Aim just in front of his face.
He aready made the deal..
Never mind that, where are we now.
Gimme a minute.
Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.
I've seen that before. Never had anyone actually do it.
We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?
Nice?
In him?
If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.
Bit expensive, sir.
...Foreign service.
Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
It may have been affected.
When you do...
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
Don't you want to get out?
Not...complaining, actually.
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?
You may you find all the solitude you want.
Now you know what I know.
Yes...What is it?
Dinner...tonight.
Let you leave without it.
What way?
You mean from it.
You again.
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
If I was with you, I wouldn't
And how'm I doing?
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
What did you tell them?
He didn't.
What's Gruner like?
Where we going?
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
Are you alright?
What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
Just like that?
Kiss her you fool.
I knew it. I told him.
He can't help us.
Must be a fulfilling occupation.
Is there anything else?
You can't take that.
It's alright.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Ow?...
Hi, honey.
Let me tell you something, Lowell. Look, look, look. You're talking about two agents in a regional office in Louisville. I got the goddamn Unabomber threatening to blow up LAX! I gotta move 45 agents from all over the country into L.A.  Alright? When I get a chance, I'll give it a look...
Three hours.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
I don't know what he was thinking.
I can't get out of here til mid- morning. I'll be in tomorrow night...  Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi...
Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on "60 Minutes"?
So, what are you going to do?
The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!
I'm afraid you are.
And what are you implying?
Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?"
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
Yeah?
You ready...?
Is there any more rice...?
What do you need at the store?
There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
Thank you, Bob.
Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye. 
From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
Yeah, I'm here.
...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
So, is everything okay?
I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. This is a news organization. People are always telling us things they shouldn't. We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest... And if it is, we air it.
Lowell.
Lowell.
Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first. Then I decide if I grant the interview.
Who's that?
I know what I have to know.
Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?
Did work.
How much would I get paid?
What do...
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
Hello. You there
The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
Why?
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
You believe that?
What's changed?
...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn't handle it the right way...
Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?
Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
You greased the rails!
"Up to you, Jeffrey. That's the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to know." Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around.
What about now?
Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
What are you talking about?
Most certainly.
"You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?"
Object!
Hello.
My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind. Most people consider what they're saying... social skills... Jeffrey just charges right ahead.  Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff...
You threatening my family, now, too?
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
Baby. You are so HOT!
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
I'd just like to have a word with her.
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
Is she Asian?
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
Who was that?
Marylin! What have I done?
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
I begged you to have a baby!
Is Tong older than Ming?
It sounded like a bell.
-- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
How nice.
I assume this is on Rex?
Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared.
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same?  I assume you're a carnivore.
"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?
He'll regret this.
Oh, for the love of...
-- we are both sure that's what we want?
He's passionate.
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
I'd like to offer my congratulations. That was a beautiful gesture of Howard's.
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
Oh. And that is -- mom?
Hmmm...
She never particularly cared for me.
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
No.
I don't have a ring!
Honey, I could sit...
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
Hi.
I have a surprise for you.
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
You wounded me first, Marylin.
I was devastated. Of course.
Is this a lover?
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
He never even asked. He just assumed --
Wow.
Lilly's up.
Every week --
But you're going through with it?
So what?
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
Wait. I know you.
Did Marylin end up with money?
And it's good!
When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
Wrigley!
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
Extinguish?
No. I haven't. But I've been out of town.  Hello, Rex. Hello there.
Let me tell you something about Patty.
I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.
Three is not Farrow.
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
I've put extra men on, all along the way.
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
You only met him once .
You talk as if he were a gigoloor something.
Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
Please don't shout.
Ellie
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scareIwhen I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
Ridiculous!
Well!
I'd like to have a talk with him.
But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why
Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again.
Oh, nono.
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
If you really mean it, I will.
It's my daughter! Go after her.
What about that diamond wrist watch she had onshe can raise some money on that?
What would you like to have me do?
You thought that up all by yourself, huh?
We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.
No.
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?  Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
My ticket?
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
I never thought of that.
Of course I do. What do you mean
Chalk up one for your side. Now listen, you want to get to King Westley, don't you?  All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story, exclusive. A day-to- day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me I've got to have it.
I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came firstthen the tiethen the shirtnow, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different.  go for the shoes first. After that I
Do you mind putting out the light?
Who are you?
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
Nope. No complaints.
Must be the Spring.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get toughwe can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
I wish you'd stop being playful.
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
Peter
What's got into you?
I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat.
Thought you were hungry!
What are you thinking about?
Really?
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
Number two is a wider movementa smile goes with that onelike this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
What're you going to do?
You might give me a little credit.
Eat a carrot.
What'd you give him for the car?
Any luck?
Eight o'clock tonight.
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
But I don't go in for that kinda stuffmuch. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me. 
I've been thinking about you.
The dame's too smart for him.
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
You're drunk.
You!
Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!
See that. They're gone!
What's up?
Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
Where do you live?
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.
Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
When did you first do business with this Bertrand?
Did he pay?
So you saw Oswald how many times?
Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?
Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
Bill.
Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
Did he pay you for this?
Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in jail.  I got no reason to lie to you.  I ain't no nigger.
Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?
Lord, wake me, please.  I must be dreaming.
He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam. That's just for openers.
If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices?  Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?  Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?
Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
...Oswald?
I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
...give me protection?
Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
I believe the boys got a couple.
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
Who was paying you, Dave?
Let me get this straight, now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?
What about Ruby?
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
Are we going away, Daddy?
...you heard echoes.
Four to six.
Don't get sidetracked!  How does he get back to the States?  That's the point.  Does he have any problems?
I don't believe it!
No.
Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.  He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?
Who?
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.
One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday night date you are.  Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.
Do you have any evidence against him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter.  He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.
My sympathies.
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
Did they live?
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey."  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
And if you're wrong?
They killed him, honey.
Anything else unusual about him you'd be able to describe in a court of law, Willie?
No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
What's wrong, Lou?
Oh no!... How bad?
One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.
I know David - a strange character.
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
Post Office.
Can we find her?
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
I just plain don't trust him anymore.
I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
Pictures like this don't show up on television!
I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.
...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.
Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
And he never hit you before?
Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
They've been enlarged and show a lot of detail...
I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
I propose you accept an appointment to the bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your talent.  Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged?
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
Virginia or Elizabeth?
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
Do you walk home?
Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?
What are they?
This looks pretty good on me.
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
You see, it works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
What?
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
What's the problem?
Look, man, I know I owe you --
Great, you're here.
She sound scared?
We are. Don't worry about it.
I doubt it.  Who's your friend?
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
This is your money?
Help yourself.
What's this?
How was your flight?
I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
Are you really a bail bondsman?
He's the one who wants you.
I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.
With ten thousand? Nine.
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer.
What'dya think?
Want to hear some music?
This is pretty.
'76?
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
He told me last night.
How do you get it out?
How'd you feel about it?
Does something else worry you?
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
Does it happen to all men?
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
He tries to act cool.
What about you Max?
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.
Got another gun and a stun gun...
If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
In a dress.
How'd you find out?
Get Ordell to come to your office.
He's already there.
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
I didn't use you, Max.
I never lied to you.
We're partners.
Sometimes every day, for a while.
Oh, Miss Brown?
And what would this be, Sweet and Low?
How can you help us?
This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet, Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money exchange trial run. It's three p.m., July 4th 1997. The location is the parking structure at LAX.
The envelope contains ten thousand dollars. The subject will be delivering the currency in a...
Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
I imagine shit needs to be done.
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
I'm sure that was the idea.
She didn't say.
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.
I thought I did.
Where's the bag she gave you?
There was a guy with Melanie?
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
What about you?
Sure.
What's that fucker ever done for us?
It looks good on you.
For what?
And what was your answer?
Yeah?
What the hell you doin'?
I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how they do.
Yeah?
I bet you come here on a Saturday night, you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass.
You told em? You told em it's me?
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
When did you get out of jail?
Where at?
What for?
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
Were you a disco girl?
With Ordell?
Were you a disco guy?
Please.
Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.
Goddam you. Gimme that bag,
Is it this aisle or the next one over?
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
Who was that?
Can I ask you about Melanie?
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
I still don't understand why you keep her around.
Uh-huh.
Couldn't talk to her?
So you're sure she's dead.
Louis?
I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
I'm going out for a few hours.
That's Winston. He works here.
So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?
Ten thousand sounds high.
What's his full name?
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
Hey, Max.
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
You know who this is?
The bond collateral on Beaumont Livingston you moved over to cover Miss Brown, remember?
How the fuck did he find me?
She's been there since Thursday night.
Uh-huh.
Turn left.
My money's in that office, right?
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
Who is it?
Hello.  Hey, Jackie...  No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
Take me home.
Remember?
Well, how do I look?
You're hurting me!
Hey, wait!
I'm too messed up to teach.
I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said.
Not me, buddy.
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words.  Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you?
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
It's not healthy with it closed.
Jacob, what can I do?
Why didn't you turn on the light?
I moved the couch. That's all.
That help?
Where'd you leave 'em?
Yeah, but for what?
I'm going home.
Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.
It's still there, Jake.  Even if you never say a word about it. You can't spend two years in Vietnam ...
We're at Della's.
What do you mean? Where do you think?
How high is that?
What'd the doctor say?
He's coming right over.
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time.  Hello! Anybody home?  Anybody in there?
We're all angels, you know ...  ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see.
He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
It's just me.
Don't!
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
Where are they?
Where have they gone?
What's going on?
I don't know you.
You know goddamn well what I mean.
You look upset.
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
Oh?  Where you going?
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Where are they?
Where have they gone?
Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.
None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?
How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it.
I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
I think I'm falling asleep.
And no more demons. I told you they'd be gone.
How 'bout over there?  No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room.
Where's Wong?
He's burning up.
Clear the area. This is an order!
I'll page him.
Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick.
I just need to talk.
I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home.
Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about.
The army?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
I have some ice from the machine.
On top of him?
Watch it punk, I'm armed.
That sucks. Why won't he go down?
Asshole that does not count as a kill.
I don't have all day, kid.
Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
Nice touch.
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
Kay-Em!
Where is...?
Earth II.
My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
What the hell are you doing?
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
Outta here?
Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!
We're screwed!
That's why I'm here.
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
He's trying to ask you out on a date.
Push off toward us.
Close the fucking door!
You must shut down the engines.
I knew you were a little sick, but Geez.
I'm missing two!
You think it killed . . .  Yeah, I guess not.
You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
Jesus!
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.
Barbie from hell...
Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
Do I have to?
You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.
I'm sending you the files.
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.
What good will that do?
Yes!
Did you bring a check?
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there...
Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.
You got it?
Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour...
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
He's trying to sink us!
Probably out in the back yard.
You want to go through those?  I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop. It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity. Pick out what you want to keep -- it's mostly your city clothes.
It's three feet deep, Martin
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
How come you have to tell them that?
You too, sweetheart...
I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things.
Only 24 hours!
He lost it on the way up.
You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.
...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence.
Where'd you get all this?
What happened?
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
I hope we get some more help.
This has got to be one big violation...
Quint...?
Think the tide's with us?
Christine what?
...So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat.
Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering.
You do this all the time, right, Charlie?
Look at him take it!
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
What have you got there, Lenny?
Ha. City hands. You been counting money. If you had a $5000 net and $2000 worth of fish in it, and along comes Mr. White, and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls. If you'd ever worked for a living, you'd know what that means.
Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?  Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower?
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...
That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!
I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state.
Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
Well! Nothing like experimenting.
What's up?
I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge?
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
We could get back together too.
That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
Wizard!
Mine too.
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
Did you hear it's yours?
What? I'm not made of stone.
What is your job title, exactly?
Nails? Really?
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.
Cool it.
Wow, dream big!
Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid.
What? My eyes are not lying!
Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.
Yeah.
When was this, like '96?
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
Like what?
Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
What is it?
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
No.
But I thought you'd be cool if...
This...  ...this is what my life has become. Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. Is that so appealing to you?
Uh, hi Su-Chin.
You should try Adderall.
Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails.
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.
Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
Who is the kid?
Hi Dad.
Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
I sort of already have.
Maybe you're having twins. Maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice!
Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
The Penny Saver sucks.
Look at this one "Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other."  "All that's missing is your bastard."
Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.
No way! She's pretty.
Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
What would be a good time for you?
Like what? Be a rock star?
You lose!
...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
Are you takin' the pictures?
You took this picture?
Hold still.
Carryin' a gun.
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
Early, what're you doin'?
What the hell is this stuff?
Yeah but, what is it?
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
Where you from Walter?
Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele haven't had time for breakfast, Early.
This the book your writing?
This guy killed a mess of people.
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
Ya see what I'm sayin'?  Ha!
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
So how's it going?
You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
Brian I want him out of our car!
I'm sorry, but I just can't see you veggin' out in LA-LA LAND.
Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
You were plenty hot.
...Janitor's job.
What about the owner of the house...  ...this John Diebold, any idea where he might be?
Yes. Altogether.
Were they wearing condoms?
Shit.
She can fuck?
Oh shit. How long did it take?
Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time.
But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.
Can you do it man?
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection.
I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.
So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
How much you gonna take?
You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?
Hurry up man. Let's be out. I wanna go swimmin'.
Casper, where's Telly.
Where you at?
Where you goin' tonight?
I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.
What?
Sup. Sup.
Hey.
You know I've been thinking about you lately.
Come on. It'll be fun. We'll just bug out. There should be a bunch of people. It'll be fun I promise.
I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head.
I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it.
Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.
You know what I want to do?
No. I'm OK. Thanks.
Yeah.
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
Telly says was up.
Do you know where he went?
Yeah. And sex is just like, yeah let's have sex.
Yep. That's the best way. It's that boom boom boom.
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
So that's why Casper is how he is.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
Hello?
What are you guys doing?
You want a wip-it?
First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.
Right.
By yourself?
Casual.
All you gotta do is look at the map.
The door was open.
You got it on the board.
You're a lying bastard!
The message!  I figured out--
Debi Rutlege.  Female.  Caucasian. Twenty four.  Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel.
We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.
Take it easy.  Both of you.
I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
To get your attention.
And -- what path is that?
You know her?
How?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.
What word did you leave last night?
Hello, Peter.
Let me speak to my daughter.
Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
There's three.  The first is 1983. Lionel Baines.  The Boston...
1985.  Hans Korshaud.
What scars?
They asked who would be best suited for this and you--
Feeling better?
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
You must be Erica.
I know he really likes you.
Okay.  Nice meeting you.
What are you doing up?
Has he gotten through to any?
Don't you have something you want to say to David?
You ready?
It isn't Kathy.
How long she been dead?
Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on.  What'd he do?
I know you're busy so I'll get right to it.  Did you know her?
Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
That's it?
It's a commercial area.  No one lives there.
As large as castles, you are still light as the air, one hundred men can't move me.  It's posed as a question. What am I?
He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.
Did you send the car?
You opened with the English.  Lutz won't use it.  He opened his first game with it.
We got a problem?
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
You.
I know it was bad.
I'm not playing a game now.
You can turn everything around so easily.  This is not just another game, is it?
Fine.
You.
Nothing.
In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?
Exactly.  It's the key.
He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces.  All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  Why?
Hi.
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
How did you know it was "carefully"?
You're right.  The killer told me.
You're going to be late for your match.
Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
You will go alone.
You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?
There is no other way.
You must break when the strain becomes too great, or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most. What did she answer?
No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us.
You choose these?
They know when they're going to die?
But you suspect.
She must make a glaive.
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
They can be saddled.
I road them often in my youth.
Even by you?
Help! Help! I'm drowning!
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ...
My <u>friend</u>.
They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.
They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.
I'm not hungry.
Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.
My heart stays here.
If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
We meant only to please you.
I can't hold the weight of both of you!
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.
Yes.
She has the power of vision.
I was beautiful then.
But you would not stay with me.
She was not as beautiful.
Do not try your trickery on me!
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
Give me his name, I will mail him.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
I can't believe it! "Yes I think"... How she kids me! I can't believe it!  And did he pass your threshold or not?
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
It's better...  You see, it's my turf, so I don't want contracts I'm not informed about, on my turf.  I'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?
At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
Tell me... The money I earn and you keep for me...
OK, I'm fine.
Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?
130... 140...
Rocket launcher.
Who'll I aim at?
What's up? I don't feel you're concentrated.
It's incredible! How did you do it?
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
Come on, get down!
Mathilda? May I come in?
Stop. Everyone is looking.
...OK.  I love you anyway.
...Shit!!  We'd found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?
It's too big.
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
...No...
How many girlfriends did you have?
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
I don't know... Five minutes.
You say it just to calm me!
You can't sit here like that.
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
...OK... Good.
...Who sent you?
Is he still alive?
Have you ever been in Messina, son?
Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --
A.P.B.... He isn't breaking any law.  He's a grown man... He can crawl on his hands and knees to China if that's what he wants to do.
How long does this... Mania last?
The normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion.  This is called, "Claudication,"  As a result, there isn't enough circulation to your body.  That accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms I'm sure you've encountered.
What steps do we take now?
So what's the deal Maurice?
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
Just for curiosity sake that's all?
Yes?
The new store?
A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.
Walk with me?
I thought we both wanted the same things.
I want children.
Your father?
I don't know.
The beach of Pacifica, California.
What did they ask?
Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.
To where?
Why?
Doubts?  About what?
I thought you were asleep.
There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
Perhaps there's another route?
What are you saying?  This story is too big for this paper?
Umm, he's going to make it isn't he?
They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
What happened?
When are you leaving?
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
You're walking to California?
I missed you Kris.
Adelle told me, your writing is going well.  The Crusader for social issues and all.
I haven't been too punctual with the rent.
Come on Mr. Parker.
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did.
You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.
Good morning.
May I ask you a question that might sound strange?
He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
Water?
I guess I do too.
I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
Yes.
This is the home of an angel.
Thank you. What time is it?
I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
What do you mean?
Me neither.
You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
Hi!
Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?
Why?
No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes?
I like women who wear mismatched earrings.
How are you doing?
You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
What did they look like?
How'd this happen?
Where are you staying?
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
I'm pleased with you, Sera... how you have moved up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the streets...  and how you repay me.
Harvard Law School?
What alibi?
Brooke, I believe you. But a jury is gonna want an alibi.
What?
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan of yours!
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
Did you hear a shot fired?
How many, would you say?
And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right?
Dewey Newcomb?
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
So everything you just said --
You're not going up there.
I'm sorry?
Uh -- both?
I think so...
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic?  So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the one"?
You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah.
I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty.
Uh -- family.
The idiot speaks.
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
You almost had me fooled.
You're pawning The Rock?!
Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.
Here. You're gonna need this.
It's Elle!  Guess what I'm doing right this second?
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?
A) He's an old man with a really big penis. B) She never told me I was fat. And C) Victoria Principal sells on that network.
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
In that case, maybe Heyworth got fellated by a brunette and Brooke caught him.
Someone missed you.
No -- it's just -- not me.
Oh, he is so over on this campus.
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
Almost.
What?
What're you doing here?!
I did?
You don't really believe she's innocent?
Wait -- my social events schedule is missing.
Of course.
I completely agree.
C'mon. Let me take you home.
Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
You got into Harvard Law?
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
Hovering?
Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough?
You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final.
Fool's magic.
Fire moat... why do that?
More fun win battle?
Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!
Like some vile toadstool.
Do you feed on mice and rats?
Damn you!
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
Might we watch, too?
Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay.
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
You come stealee tleasoo?
No, wait... please... listen...
Oh, but you will be, Jack... Think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a-dancing?
And if I cannot?
It's bluebells!
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all.  And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...?  If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time.
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
Here now.  Toss her this when you've the chance.  Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass.  She's terribly vain.  Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle.
A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.
What is it?
Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."
This is ogre's magic.
I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
Don't let this talk of heroes upset you, Jack.  Sigurd's sword is no great thing.  The Volsung killed Fafnir.  You killed Lindfarne. That's one worm apiece... I'd say you and Sigurd were neck-and-neck.
A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?
That's it!  The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.
Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory?
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
Aye.  We're good as inside.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
The kitchen be the most important room in a palace, for if the victuals ain't right, little else is likely to be so.
Hey!  Stop it!  I can't see.
Can't we move any faster?
On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --
Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!
Well done, lad.
Sweet slippers of Oisin!
Aye... my Lord...
Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored.
You promised!
Liar!
A promise is a sacred oath.
I detest serpents.
How much longer?
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
What happened?
Who?
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
He did run?
There are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood.
There's no happier thought under heaven.
My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
What have I done?
Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me.
Step lively now!
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
How do I get the horn back?
What became of the princess?
No!
I don't believe you.
I'd be honored.
Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
Where?
Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.
Is he a friend, then?
Simple as that, eh?
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
Marco!
That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up.  Huh, Mom?
Mom?
I put him to work.
I couldn't get it to go down.
I'm living here while I build another house.
Can you keep Sam straight?
You're a good girl.
You have to ask like that?
I might not stay, anyway.
I've seen lots of people.  It's not a big thing for me.
Why are you so uptight?
Josh said...
Why is that?
This is such a street of whiners.
Are you guys' friends?
Bob Larson.  Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen?
An exhaust system or a window is code.
I've got one favor to ask.
Sam?
Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?
I hate turkey.
It bugs me.
You'll have money when you work.
No one would blame me if I left!
I'm not doing it!
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
Well, until you know, you can't go.
Oh, so you're in the big shit now!  Child abuse.  People go to prison for what you just did to me.
I'm not even listening.
Twenty years of hating what you live in...what you are.  This is the end of it, Sam.  I'm gonna build something of me here that I can be proud to give to you.
I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
I gave up on you.
Are you talking?
Why wouldn't she leave?
I loved him too much.
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
You look better than ever.
I still don't know what that means.
I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
Ah!  Oh....
Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
How many bedrooms will your house have?
I didn't think you'd know I went missing.
Four days.  I left to think.
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
What was I supposed to do?  When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working.
We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.
I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today.
You head was pressed against my chest.  I could feel your heart racing.  And I remember I kissed your hair.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
Go in there and lick his attitude.
Where's Sam?
I thought we were helping.
You've never said that before.
Let's not do this, okay?
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
What's your deal with Alyssa?
He already knows everything about what he can't do.  You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.
I don't have a clue anymore.  I wish you'd talk to him.  He needs a man.
Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?
To shave your chest?
I was talking about our marriage.
I thought I might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle.
I guess I could teach you some things.
The door was open.
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
All day again?
No, nigger.
Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle Leg, you think you could squeeze me in?
Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
You know I trust you, Claude.
I don't see no wedding ring, Banks. Conjugal visits are for married prisoners only.
For the kind of money they charge here, you'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes.
Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?
Can't you remember your own name?
Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's never happened before.
Don't I know you?
Where they taking us, anyway?
What are they gonna do to us?
I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles.
You mean this sign? The one that says "No Coloreds Allowed." That's a good question. Ray, how come we missed the sign?
Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.
Alright. You want some pie?
Oh, I don't know, maybe because our lives depend on it, I just sort of thought you knew what you were doing!
Reward?
Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.
Guess we better get going, huh?
What are you talking about?
What do you think you're doing?! The man's been dead for two seconds! Don't you have any respect?
This fork is filthy.
What's up, Ray?
What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
No.
Does that mean I'm in?
All right, man, just settle down. We'll get outta here, Claude. We'll get outta here real soon.
Crawfords.
It's a pardon from the governor.
I don't see you coming up with any plans.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
What the hell are you doing?
Wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he asked me to fill in for him.
Damn, it was getting hot in there.
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
No, I'm gonna kill him --
Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning. I got an erection.
Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?
How you doin'?
You ever done time before?
Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg.
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
We don't need no fences at Camp 8, boss.
Alright, listen up! I want every man lined up out here in the yard on the double! Let's move it!
Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
That's right, fellas. Catch any cab heading uptown. All the drivers know Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
I can't take that, mama.
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
Lemonade?
I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
If you don't mind my saying, you seem mighty familiar with your house boy.
Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton Club?
Hey, Ray, what's the name of that nightclub of yours?
What's the Boom Boom Room?
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
Of course I can. Drink or she dies.  Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going.
Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
Now will you get in the flask?
I lowered the drinking age to ten.
She goes to Parson's, right?
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
Wow. What... what did she look like?
Where did you meet my father?
Valerie's crying!
Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
Did you just talk?
Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
I didn't murder anybody
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
Now that was an experience. "You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time.
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
You're a good devil, Dad.
This is bad, Nicky.
To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.
Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle.
Thanks.
Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
There's our man.
What's with that guy?
Looking for the chief.
Schnapps...
Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
Adrian?
You got the wrong window again, man.
You think I'm a tourist?
Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why.
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
It's freezing my hands.
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
What were you thinking coming here?
Valerie?
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
Off limits.
Why is that funny?
A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.
And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months?  What happens when you're sixteen and you go green?
Why?
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
Who invited you?
That was a great shot you made.
What the hell took you so long?
That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!
Please... no?  You mean "not here" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.
Yes... probably he was renewed?
I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
I couldn't get you out of my mind.
Maybe... sure...
Of course.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
About running, dying what?
Where did you get that?
And then you killed him, right?
What're you going to do?
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
When did you begin to question Lastday?
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,
Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.
Will you take me with you?
I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.
I have never seen a face like that before. It must be the look of great age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
"Beloved son"...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?
What does that water do?
What kind of jewel is this?
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
What people?
Hello, Sandman.
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
Are there any other humans?
Where are they?
They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
Well? How do you like it?
Sure, what's wrong with that?
This rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, Carl. Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?
You okay, man?
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
Why not?
No.
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
Hi.
What deal?
What's he do?
So, should I call Andy?
I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else...  To a girlfriend's house.  But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
Where's the bathroom?
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy. Can you take care of Mr. Smith now?
Better.
Sheila?
Never saw him before in my life.
We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night.
A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
His condition? What do you mean?
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
You talk to him?
We saw you that night, Pete.
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
I wouldn't know how.
When he went to work, right.
We know that.
He's not Madison?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
I'll get a manual.  and study it.
Something wrong?
What's bothering you, Madison?
That's why I married you.
Who's it from?
It must be from a real estate agent.
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
I thought there might be somebody inside.
Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. 
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
Mr. Eddy?
Okay.
What's goin' on?
What are you guys doin'?
What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.
What else about that night?... Did anything happen?
No... I told you.
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
Why don't you like me?
Conway's gone again! Run out! Listen to this! From Gainsford.
I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?
Fossils, huh?
Found in Asia!
Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers!
Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
Yes.
And mine's Conway.
And the wine - excellent.
We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
I surprise you? Now that's news.
Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course.
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.
No porters here!!
I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.
Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
Oh, immediately.
In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
As far away as I ever want to be.
The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
You're lying, aren't you?
I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
What are these people?
What's it mean?
Hello, George.  Cigarette?
Well - I mean
Uh-huh.
Porters?
George, come back!
What about the porters?
For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of
Why not? What's going to stop me?
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
You say the porters are waiting for us?
That fellow got on at Baskul.
I guess we're in for it.
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
What do you suggest?
Yes.
There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
Thank you.
I'm so glad.
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
I've thought about it for years.  I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave.  Am I forgiven for sending for you?
Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse us, we're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home.
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
Thank you.
Wait.  Uh-- sir.  Please.  Anyway.  Hook-head-guy.  I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--
Sir.  I thought those records were sealed.
Only the damn guy won't know it.
Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
It's a bug.
So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
I know, I know.  I read the manual. No attachments.  We work alone. Blah. blah.
Ha ha.  No, really.
Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?
Now what?
What's going on, Kay?
Jesus...
Great.  Fine.  Listen, why don't we call the pentagon, maybe they'll take you back with the new age well wishers.  I'll stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs.
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
It's marble.
Would you call this a code 100?
You were saying?
You coulda told me what you were doing.
Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs out with dead people.
Kay, you're scaring your partner.
I'm just wondering what's so great out there that everyone's trying to get to it?
Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
So... how'd you hear about this?
Right, right-- I like that stuff.
I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
When?
Yeah ... ?
Your licence is revoked. Permanently.
Not bad.  Briliiant, actually.  You come unarmed, and alone.  Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?
Goodwill...
Nowhere.
Oh yeah?  Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to?  You know how many rules you've just broken?
... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?
Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
Found it.
We need to talk to you about the alien.
Which way?
How's Dee?
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
He's gone, too.
How'd you know?
What?
No.  Follow him.
He's here.
Oh, God...
Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
She grew up.
I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
And replace them with new ones.
Why?
You don't remember me, do you?
There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
I'm setting up a timer.  When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  But not before then, or you'll --
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
Huh, we don't seem to have her data.
Tell me not to worry, John.
And you say the third prevision was, what, a little fuzzy or something?
You understand, John, that the minute Precrime goes national, they're going to take it away from us.
I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
John --
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
Somewhere near the capital?
Go ahead.
You guys are nodding your heads like you actually know what the hell he's talking about.
The victim's name is Leo Crow.
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
Really?  You've never been inside?
So I'll be the first one to go in then?
I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
But you call this room the "temple".
It seems I've found a flaw, John  You.
Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
She was looking right at me.
I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
She's got information inside of her.  I need you to get it out.
What the hell.
I wanted to.
Do you know who I am?
... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.
Tell me, who was it, set this up?
Let go of the gun.
Something wrong?
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
Just what is it you think I can do for you?
So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
You want to bring it down.
I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
The guy from USA Today is here.
He just wanted a few minutes before --
Sir, the press conference is starting.
You have an emergency call on your private line.
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
Good God.  What was that?
I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
Precog Deja Vu...
So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.
Can't they shut that off?
Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.
Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket.  There's fewer consumers down there, which means fewer scanners to target him.
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
He's trying to prove his innocence.
What kind of cop were you before this?
John Anderton was my friend!
He looks familiar.
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
Since right after we lost our son.
It was nobody's fault.
What was it then?
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben.
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here.
Oh no. What is it this time.
Nobody's fuckin talking to you.
A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
Honey?
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
You talk to Max today?
I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
Go finish getting ready. I'll take care of dinner.
I want you to quit.
She needs a family. A dad. I'll give her what you never had.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
Whu --
Get your hands off of her.
Well, you look it. You win?
What's your record at?
What's up? Jess ready?
He making the drop?
So, when's the drop.
So what do we do?
He must have that shit troughed.
That it?
A million. Easy.
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.
Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
I got a way we make everybody happy.
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear?
I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club --
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
Hi. I, uh, think that's us.
What's that?
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
I can wait around if you want.
Spa?
Taken care of?
Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...
I'm on the phone.
Any time, bro.
You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.
I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
Come on, man. Not with the owners here.
We need guns.
Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.
I don't know.
See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets.
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
What exactly did they say?
Nothing else.
This is bullshit, man.
What the fuck do you have to complain about?
You sold it? I thought they stole it.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him?
Yeah. What vibe?
So is this the drop?
What the hell did you do?
Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.
All the more reason.
Wanna bet?
That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
It's gonna be fine.
Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.
No. I'll wait here.
Hey, boys.
Fine, fine. And you were...?
We rep lines? You know? Fashion?
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
What's up, man.
You look good, man.
Sure. Anyplace in particular?
No, really, mate?
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
Come, now. You just got here.
Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
I can't yet vouch for the amount, unless you want me to sit here and count.
Is it nice?
Sure. You boys want anything?
What about my keys?
Don't worry. I get it.
What the fuck you think, I wanna 'hang' with you motherfuckers? Yeah you're working. And put down the champagne.
So, we're talking money laundering...
Edinburgh.
Scotland.
Sombitch and I ain't never been to Beantown.
Why?
When?
How's it feel?
Ain't nuthin' in the world to give you that real deep cool. Like girl. You there?
Shit, what else she gonna say?
It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
What did you give it to me for then?
What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?
You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.
I will do it.
I can't.
Could we sit down someplace?
Let's talk about you for a change.
Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
It won't be easy.
I just want to sit here and be still.
"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
We need you too!
Get some sleep.
Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.
Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
Just what are you saying?
Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
Can I ask you something?
I thought you said we were going to the movies last night.
The average first offender gets two years for burglary. We were all first offenders. That's what Sophia and Peg drew --
But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
Sweetie, they're almost ready.
You evil this morning.
Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart.
Bang, bang. You're dead.
Don't never try to cross someone who ain't afraid to die.
Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off.
You want to be the head man?
The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
[Where are you coming from?]
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
[Why?]
I need something. Do you have banking connections?
[What is his name?]
[Who pays you?]
[Who killed her? You?]
[Who's the boss?]
[What money?]
[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]
[I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.]
[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
Were you provided with a gun?
But don't you stay in El Paso?
How long you staying, Crease?
Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth.  Rocket launchers?
That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him with when he left.
Not at all?
Hmmm?
So you were unhappy?
You're fast.
What are you doing?
Well, it's a sort of wife.
So how come you know so much about those countries?
Remember you asked me what state I was from?
Did you used to?
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
Jordan!
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
I don't believe you.
You're lying. I don't believe you.
I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
[You have the money.]
[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
Good news. You're going back to school.
I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.
I think it's nice he's American.
He has to go, Samuel.
Creasy.
[Then what do you have to lose?]
[Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday.]
Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew really.
I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl...
I told you she wasn't attractive...
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
So waddaya feel like doing tonight?
Well, we're back to that, huh? I say to you, "What do you feel like doing tonight?" And you say to me, "I don't know, what do you feel like doing?" And then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer, watching Sid Caesar on television. Well, I tell you what I feel like doing. I feel like calling up this Mary Feeney. She likes you.
My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?
Are you kidding?
Marty, your mother wants you onna phone.
We gotta postcard from my son Nickie and his bride. They're inna big hotel in Florida on their honeymoon. Everything is very nice.
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
What they say?
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
You will see. A coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house.
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?
You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face.
I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
I think you're kidding yourself, Clara. I used to think about moving out, you know? And that's what I used to say. "My mother needs me." But when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all. Actually, you need your father. You know what I mean? You're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life.
Siddown, take off your coat. You want something to eat? We gotta whole half-chicken in the icebox.
You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.
Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
I'm just here with another girl.
What I like about Mickey Spillane is he knows how to handle women. In one book, he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car, and she throws a pass at him. And then he meets two beautiful twins, and they throw passes at him. And then he meets some beautiful society leader, and she throws a pass at him, and...
It's loaded with what?
Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance hall, and that's all it is. I been there a hundred times. Loaded with tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
Hello, Marty, when you come home?
She's more than twenty-nine years old, Marty. That's what she tells you.
...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street.
Hello, Ralph.
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
No, that's my sister Margaret's husband, Frank. My sister Margaret, she's married to the insurance salesman, and my sister Rose, she married a contractor. They moved to Detroit last year. And my other sister Frances, she got married about two and a half years ago in Saint John's Church on Kingsbridge Avenue. Oh, that was a big affair. Well, let's see now, that'll be about a dollar- seventy-nine. How's that with you?
When you gonna get married, Marty? You should be ashamed of yourself. All your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children. I just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, "Hey, you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter with you? That's no way. Now you get married.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
Okay.
Tommy!
Tommy...
Tommy...
What do I do with it Hawk? This is a little out of my line.
Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.
What are you going to do with him?
Stop him! Stop that man!
I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
Where?
Don't you use olives?
So long, Ho-Jon.
What?
You mind if we get out of this guy's brain first?
We've stuck it out for a whole week now... Pretty girl.
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a long way, learning to put up with a couple of crazy Yankees, but...
Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.
I have a tent to myself.
Give us this day our daily...
I was just asking...
If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.
Gimme three.
I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not.
And there it is.
Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
Radar!
B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
We're throwing him a Last Supper. We came to invite you.
We stand behind all our work.
I'm not so sure the goddam thing's in his heart.
Look.
If we squeeze him through, I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College.
I don't feel anything.
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?
He only lasted one season.
Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army.
Hey, Knocko, I got those pictures you promised to look at of my kids. You too, Wilma. It won't take a minute.  You can see them too, if you want.
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
What's the matter?
Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces.
Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long.
How did you get called that?
But I'm married.
You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
They missed the boat.
If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.
Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
That's really what I came here for. See what you guys recommend.
Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.
Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.
The blonde dish.
You don't aim to cause any trouble  But?
What's going on? Who started this?
We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch.
O'Reilly!
Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
O'Reilly, what is it?  There aren't more choppers coming?
Sir?
Sir?
Good morning, Colonel.
Can you make out what they're talking about?
Chopper coming in, Colonel. Two of them, I'm afraid.
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
Thank you, Spearchucker. I'll certainly take a look at these. Where the hell did you ever get that name?
This one goes right to the OR. Tell Duke to do him ahead of the busted spleen.  And this kid can't wait. I'll take him myself, before I get to that ruptured diaphragm.
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
Can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?
How is he?
Ease off on those tapes, and let's see how much it bleeds.  How is he?
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
Against anything. Just protest.
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
Yes!
Of course not. He wouldn't be.
Say, he's a friend of mine.
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
Uh-huh . . .
Did you write this?
Thank you very much for everything.
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. WellI don't quite know what to say . . .
Oh.
Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
What?
That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!
The letter.
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
Very pretty. Very pretty, indeed, Miss Mitchell. But would you mind telling me who goes on Christmas Eve?
Hurry up, Pop.
Well, maybe you're right.
Yes.  What's he doing here?
Okay, fellows.
What's the idea?
Listen. If that guy lays an egg. I want to get something out of it. I'm getting a Jane Doe ready!
Colonel!
Where's Connell?
No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
Hey, boss. Get a load of this.
Yeah, Boss?
Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe!
You don't have toWhy, we're with you, Mr. Doe. We just lost our heads and acted like a mob. Why, we . . .
This is Sourpuss. Er, excuse me. Er, Mr. Smithers, Mr. Doe.
No!
How could he be a fake? 
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
Sure, you are.
You win, Colonel. Here's the fifty. Go on out and get rid of it.
I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myselfI get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named Jeffersonand Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean?
All right! Now, supposing a certain unmentionable worm, whose initials are D. B., was trying to use that to shove his way into the White House. So he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. What would you say about that? Huh?
Go down to the office and arrange for some radio time.
Well, I'm stuck with two and twobut I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?
Only one thing to do, Hank. Drop the whole business quickly.
Show me an American who can keep his mouth shut andI'll eat him.
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
What are you doing up here then?
What difference does that make?
Pretty good?  Say, I was just about ready for the major leagues when I chipped a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin' a nineteen-inning game!
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a
Racket? What do you mean?
Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!
I know one way you can do it.
Have you got the speech I gave you?
Spencer of the Chronicle .
Is there a crowd in the street?
Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.
No shit! He's good!
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave.
Who's controlling your mind?
Tell me what's wrong.
I hate fucking Springfield.
What do you got on Korda?
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
Are you in charge, Roper?
I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
For now that's all.
What's the point of this?
I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be.
So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?
You don't like New York?
Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide.
I can't do that.
What's the first commandment?
I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
The 6 horse is still last.
COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
We won.
Is it always like this?
He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything.  How are we going to get me in there?
I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
This baseball player you're going out with...  He's no good for you.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
You think I didn't need you?
It's already started.
What do you think?
When?
You like this place?
I was just thinking...  There's something special I want to talk to you about.  I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship.  A deeper level.
That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
And a car.
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
Roper...
What do you want?
How come I can't remember?
That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
Your life that bad?
The guests are here.
What's happening?
You are not a God.
You were the one who was dying.
You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
With the energy from the net, we can program this world anyway we want.  Redwood forests.  Oceans. Mountains --
But what if he doesn't --
Won't be time if he gets access --
Try harder.
A hotel?
Christoph was in charge of designing building modules.
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
An interface attendant.
I've got to get back.
Then how do you know about --
Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.
We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
Identical.  One's you.  One's digital.
But I don't know anything about programming.
Don't know what you're talking about.
My uni-net account.  I log on.  The program's there.
Transmit copy of program via satellite north uplink.
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
Rangers...  I'm afraid you're too late.
So how can we get to it?
Release the power WITH the power.
Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late!  Ivan is on his way here!
You okay?
Two thirty three a.m.
009843... 42... 41!  WE'RE IN ALIGNMENT!
FOUR SECONDS TO IMPACT!
The earth was hurtling toward us at seven hundred miles per hour, and we knew at that moment that we were facing death straight in the eye.
SKULL!!
I'm outta here.
GET OFF ME!
No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.
"Basically".
I hope those Rangers put that lousy lowlife out of his misery!
THREE SECONDS!!
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
You own a hotel, sir?
We're asking you to go to prison.
So Chicago's been good to ya.
One fuckin' year ago I had ta hit you up for train fare. Now I can buy the fuckin' train. And I ain't even a fuckin' Sicilian!
We have a commission. If there's a dispute over territory, the commission decides.
Boo-Boo.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
What do you mean?
Their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in Sicily.
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
Four-twenty-eight.
Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.
Bastard didn't even show.
Masseria's confused. He can't figure whether you're workin' for Maranzano, or gettin' ready to kill the bastard. So he's spreadin' the word that you're goin' after Profaci because it happened on his turf. I figure Masseria's gonna try to rub out Profaci, and pin it on us. Then Maranzano will have to kill ya.
Masseria's tryin' ta find a way around ya. But his patience won't hold out much longer.
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
You ain't even a man yet.
Where'd ya get this funny ravioli?
The deal's too good, Frankie
Well...
You got something to hide?
I booked passage to London.
If I look weak now, it's over.
A lot of shit came out of me in the hospital. I'm sorry you got hit by it.
Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.
Who'll make the rules?
Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?
You fellas got names?
Bugsy, you and I don't need to be in business with Maranzano. We got more jobs than we can handle. That's not the problem.
We'll figure out something.
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
We're going to Atlantic City for the honeymoon.
I been thinkin'...
How soon can we pull this off?
You're getting' 10 cc's
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.
We're gonna change it, Bugs. Once we get rid of the Dons, the Commission's gonna rule. No more wars. No more vendettas. No more Boss of All the Bosses.
I'm glad ya come.
You boys carryin' pieces?
You're a smart boy, Charlie, but there's somethin' you ain't learned yet. A man needs a family.
This business is about taking risks.
Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
What the fuck does that mean?
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears.
What are ya thinkin'?
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
Every successor will owe his loyalty to us. Together we take out Maranzano, and each family gets a piece of his operation.
When ya got all that blood workin' in your belly, it ain't upstairs where it needs to be.
Don Maranzano. Welcome.
The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman.
You get fifteen percent.
Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
The terms will be mine.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
Why didn't you tell me that Maranzano had made you an offer?
Know somethin'? This stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
What's it worth to ya, Boss?
Special occasion?
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
Jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but I never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.
What?
"4/17: Subject, when unaware of observation, prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. Successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet."
Olive or eyeball?
Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die.
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
You're really gonna pop the question?
Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.
So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big piata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - <u>hundreds</u> of 'em.
Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ?
Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you!
I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
I'm reportin' this to my union!!
I'm so dumb! I <u>deserve</u> to die -
Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resum. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
How are you doing sweetheart?
He seemed quite taken with you.
You know, you never tell me anything.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made at three and four in the morning.  So, I called the number ... and a woman answered.  And I ... I hung up.  So, then I followed him.  Just like in the movies.  And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn.  We had been going together for almost a year.
He's an organic farmer.
This is one-way street.  You go down the block to the middle.
Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
And while you're at it, get me a bed!
Tell me why!
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
Oh--that again. Yeah.
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor--on a tight-rope.
What dame?
Every time I think of it, I get a laugh, Diz.
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
My first name's--Clarissa.
Then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that Senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! A couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. But--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, "I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?" He might *listen* to *you*--
I knew it! I knew a night's rest wasn't possible in this house!  Hubert!
Really, my dear--I don't feel like a thing.
I do *not* want a Senator. And I do *not* want any more of this nonsense! Emma!
Emma, which is it--Horace Miller or Henry Hill?
Yes, yes--tell them I'll see them immediately--immediately!  I can't hold them off! They want something to say about this appointment. Ten to one they've got a man.
Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!
Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct.
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?
Yes. Come in.
Maybe you'd like to come along and watch, Governor? Jefferson's done a wonderful job with that leg.
A pet shop?
I just can't, son--not the head and tail both!
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
All right, Senator--let's get these bags and the livestock together--
You should hear our Ranger Band rattle that off--if you want to *hear* something! Good evening, Miss Saunders. Good evening Mister McGann.
Where were you?
Will the Senator yield?
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
--I may not know much about a lot of things, sir--but I know that Willet Creek country like a book--and--and I tell you, Senator Paine--there's something *wrong* about this dam-- why, there isn't a foot of water in that creek--it's dry four months out of the--
Ah, now, that's better.
Mr. President--
Yes, sir, you bet I would.
Jerry! Blackie! Queenie! Let's have it quiet, fellows!
Now, Amos, now--  What?
Just fine.
Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--
What's your name?
Gee--I'm sorry about that, Miss--you *are* Miss Saunders, aren't you?
One of those sightseers--you know. You see, I--gosh, I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors--
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
Good. Where are we?
Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
Have you always had to--work?
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
I've got more. You better tell me.
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--
Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream--
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
Already? All these letters?
Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
What you *have* to do is fight!
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
Yay!
Ah! That's more like it! What?
I don't understand, sir! I don't know what the gentleman--
The chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior Senator, Mr. Smith.
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
Marvelous! And what would this camp set the Government back?
Yeah! How about it? You're a nature lover. Do you handle any of that sign language?
What! Who?
H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill!
I know that.
--I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows--
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
No?
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
That Happy Hopper is tougher to handle than a prima-donna.
What do you think?
Well, what do you want me to do? Stand around like you chump and let that drooling infant wrap that Willet Creek Dam appropriation around my neck. Either he falls in line with us and behaves himself or I'll break him so wide open they'll never be able to find the pieces.
You won't stand for it?
Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together.
Mr. President...
Senator Paine will state it!
That's going to be fun.
We'd like to get in touch with him. It's very important.
Why, you own it, Longfellow.
Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in pixilated - except us.
Any children?
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
No. Are you?
And you saw them happen?
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
You are , aren't you?
You fainted.
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
Sure. I met you.
Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
Yeah, I know.
The drums. He taught me to play some.
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
Mary, I'm going home.
Would you like to read it? It's to you.
Uh-huh.
You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
The guy's balmy.
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
What'll I tell him if he calls up?
Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you!
Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?  What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he
It's for you. In a couple weeks you'll get the itch so bad, you'll be working for nothing.
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
How's it going? Okay?
Gold, eh?
Stuff, sir?
Sit over there, will you?
I wish you luck, sir.
You will please permit Mr. Deeds to finish.
Newspaperman?
Hang up.
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.
Why not? Who is he?
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
This afternoon - at four o'clock.
Gee, I'm busy. Did the opera people always come here for their meetings?
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to
Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.
She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "Cinderella Man." You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
That's impossible. The opera has never paid.
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
No - I don't want it, thank you.
Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
Look, he's temperamental.
Your Honor
Anything else, Mr. Deeds?
Brookfield just came in.
Say fellow, you neglected me - and I feel very put out.  Look, sock it right there, will you? Lay one right on the button,[6] but sock it hard.
Who are they?
No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married
What is your name?
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
Tails tonight, sir?
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
No, sir.
Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really must get up. It's late!
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
But she's on the telephone
It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
You can go out there if you like...
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around?
Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. First time in a long time she's been willing.
Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here.
Thank you.
What Ernest means, I think, is we're very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. We're great believers in learning from each other. I've learned so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco...
You do seem much more disposed toward him than I understand, Ernest. Did I miss something?
Interesting approach. What was his name?
What's that?
I have eighteen more minutes!
We got divorced.  I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me.
What is it?
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to...  ...I really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, I can't thank you enough for...
We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?
No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house...
What do you want to know?
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
...so rich?
I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I like my clients? I can't stand most of them! But I don't kick them out...
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
Got a license?  But no car?
I just got my license two weeks ago.
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
What's wrong with her?
It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.
I think you do.
Feel free to lie down. Most people do.
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
Is this the treatment?
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
Painful lymph glands?  Forget fulness... irritability... depression?
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
You're purposely making me talk while we do this...  ...because you think this is good for me...  ...and you're a sadistic bastard...
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
Is it something you've heard about me?
All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?
First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.
Transference!
Mother...
Sofie...
You feel violated?
But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.
...but first, you have to tell me something...
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
What are you talking about?
What did he want you to do?
...What balls on this guy? What're we...  ...going steady? Jesus.
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
You're Doc Mumford.  Skip Skipperton.
..."Find the need and fill it" my dad used to say -- I guess a lot of dads say that -- but I did and it just took off.
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
What?
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her.
Hey, Skip.
How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something...
All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
Skip, that's not much of a secret.
Who else knows?
Damn! What is your name?
Did you carry a gun?
And the drugs?
And a birth certificate is enough?
Psych major?
Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice.
Sorry...
I'm here for you, Doc.
Doc!... It's not me, is it?
It's possible. I don't know about that.
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
I never killed a priest before.
Oh yes, of course.
What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!
Let's make us even, shall we?
O'Connell! I am going to kill you for this!
Goin' somewhere?
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
I'm sorry, it was an accident.
You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.
See the cartouche there, it's the official royal seal of Seti the First, I'm sure of it.
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --
The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.
Where are they taking him?
No women allowed.
Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly?
Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.
No?
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.
For what?
That "thing" gets me excited.
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed.
You two!
I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.
I'm not?
Why would I do that?
Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.
I'm staying.
Got it!
Have you no respect for the dead?
Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours.
Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
Hey,... don't I know you?
I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
You did not!?... We're not!?
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
The jig is up, Casanova. I've spent six months watching you, and know exactly what you're up to.
I thought you were done?
Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing.
We could really use some coffee --
Come on, baby!
Who are you?
It's late. I'm headin' home.
No one will believe us.
Sounds good to me.
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
Hey... you okay?
Are you an actress?
Come here.
I'd better go.
Who?
Stay away!
Yeah.
Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.
So, let me get this straight. You have the power to become invisible.
But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
There's a big difference.
So what else has Superman got?
I'll drive.
He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!
So why don't you just tell her!
Nah.
Let's go.
Sounds good.
Maybe there was traffic.
Here you go. 
Jeffrey!
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
It is?
We may be getting in over our heads here.
But, Doc... where's the machine guns?
That was too close.
Where am I going?
My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.
Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.
But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
Proceed.
What do you think Napoleon will do?
If he withdraws his army in good order, it will be a serious political defeat.  But, if he should be caught on the move, with his army, in the full grip of winter, then it will be a catastrophe.  If Your Majesty can prolong his hopes for a treaty by silence, be deceit, by any means, for another month, thus postponing his departure, then the graves of his army are already dug in the soil of Russia.
Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?
I don't even know whether a defense is possible.
About 5,000 troops.
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
And where is the army?
And who is defending Paris?
General Bonaparte?
I believe you are acquainted with my brother, Joseph Bonaparte, and my aide, Major Junot.
Captain Charles, I believe you are one of General Le Clerc's aides-de- camp.
Just a minute, General.  Listen, don't let them fool you with all their grand la-de-da.  They've all made their money from the war -- mostly from crooked war contracts. They say Citizen Barras has put away millions.
When you eat him, may I have some?
Why didn't you wake me then?
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
I am, Citizen.  Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais?
Does your mother know you have come?
Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.
Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?
It is time to clarify the situation. Everything is over between us.
Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
May I offer you a drink?
She must have been in love with you.
Promise.
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.
I believe you sent for me.
Why did you give it to him?
What was there to tell?
How do you know?
If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
Good evening, ladies.  You must forgive me, my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you.
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
Article 46, calls for the virtual dismemberment of Prussia, reducing her population by half and her army to a token force.
Now, the section headed "Secret Clauses of the Treaty" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade.
What I am talking about is moderation.
And where do you place Alexander?
Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you come to join us?
He made friends with a family called Columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, Caroline.
Okay, I know what I want this time.
That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.
Me, too.  You think they're in there?
Who are you?
Where you going?
What's crackin'?
This you?
It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.
I ain't trying to get in it.
Craig, what the hell are you doing?
You see that?
Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's.
You're welcome, Unc.
You sure you don't wanna stay?
I will.  When can I come visit?
Hello, remember me?
Huh?
You alright?
What is it?
I'll be out in about 35-40 minutes!
What's the matter?
You coming in?
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.  Craig, what the hell wrong with you?  Where you been?
What was that?
Are they still out there?
Today ain't my day.
Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.
Ah damn.  Damn.
When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day.
Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?
Shut up!  Both of you right now!
Why would he take it?  He don't even know you.
You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.
My back.
Craig, I want you to meet my old lady, Suga.  Suga, this is Craig.
Huh?
Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
I remember you...in the elevator.
What?
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
Good luck.
Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
You're out of your mind.
I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work.
One thirty. California Ballroom.
...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
Is that something precious?
I think you better put that away.
Lynn!
I said I have to do something.
You got anything smaller?
Mister, what are you dragging me into?
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do.
Irene is going to help.
You're going to go see her.
Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
Oh, we'll have to do better than that.
Goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come here!
He brought a gun onto the pool deck.
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
That's pretty good.
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
Where is he? Did you lose him?
Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.
And what happens if I don't call you?
God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only you can help her.
What do you figure he done with it?
You killed two men, Ben Harper.
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
..."and I won't never tell about the money."
Do you mind me cussin', boy?
Where's Ruby?
And the Lord told that man --
See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
Who?
Just went?
Dear Walt and Icey: I bet you been worried and gave us up for lost. Took the kids down here with me for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm. Thot a little change of scenery would do us all a world of good after so much trubble and heartache. At least the kids will git a plenty of good home cooking. Your devoted Harry Powell
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
Lynch him! Lynch him!
Twenty-five wives!
Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul!
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
You'll get awful mad, John. I done a Sin!
Pearl! You ain't --
Where's Mom?
To see Dad?
Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!
John, where's your folks?
You don't reckon I'd leave you.
Now it's your turn.
Sure, that's no secret.
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
You see? We can't have anything to do with John.  You and me will go down to the parlor.
Yes; John's bad.
What's their names?
John: take that look offen your face and act nice.
You thought, Willa, that the moment you walked in that door I'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night. Ain't that right, now?
Do you want more children, Willa?
Mornin', ladies.
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
Shall I tell ye the little story of Right-Hand-Left-Hand -- the tale of Good and Evil?
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
What'd you all talk about?
Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
What the hell are dreams, anyway?
So we'll guard her together. Through the night.  In each others' arms like we always said.
Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.
Guess I did.
You believe in the Boogey Man?
Okay?
Yeah. So?
Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.
What!?
Decide to take a day off after all?
Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
Apparently he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina.
Mother, for petesakes.
You okay?
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.
Feeling better?
We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.
What you mean 'all at once'?
I can't believe his mother let him come over here.
Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over too. He might get jealous.
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
An evening gown.
A dress you wear in the evening.
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
What is it, Anna?
You wouldn't like Razinin.
No, that's not him...
A little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us.
Can you blame them?... at least the May Day parade is over.
And the surprise is there's nothing in it.
...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
He's cutting our throat...
Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?
It is high time you got out of Russia.
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
Good evening, Gaston.
Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?
Good evening, Your Highness.
I don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus.
That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
Halt negotiations immediately. Envoy extraordinary arrives Thursday six ten with full power. Your authority cancelled herewith. Razinin.
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.
Don't call it desertion. Our little restaurant... that is our Russia... the Russia of borscht, the Russia of beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour cream...
We don't want to be disturbed.
What proposition?
What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade?
She says she won't be intimidated by parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer.
How much does this cost?
A week?
You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.
...we have a wonderful electric sign: "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski."
Yes, monsieur?
All right, then make an appointment with her so I can see her!
If we had known we would have greeted you with flowers.
What's that?
Now, comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry.
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
What can I do about it?
Yes!
What for... why?
How long do we have to wait here?
I do not deny its beauty, but it is a waste of electricity.
Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat?
I will start with you.
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
That is correct.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
Do you hear that?
Was that talkative?
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
Then do it through my lawyer!
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
I always eat here.
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
Will you smile?
On which boat?
I have never heard one.
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
No... go on.
Did you make any change in this room?
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.
It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.
How do you do?
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.
But, darling, you can't do that.
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
No speech.
Are we going to build our little house?
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
...and we won't clench our fist...
Our salute will be a kiss.
I am so happy. No one can be so happy without being punished. I will be punished and I should be punished.  I want to confess, darling.
Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. 
Those newspaper people?
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Oh, Leon!
I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. "Caviar and Blood." Swana escapes over the ice!
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
What did he say?
Leon! What in heaven's name...!
That bad?  Old or young?
There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there?
The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.
Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.
Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.
You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
You leave me no choice.
Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels.
Unfortunately.
Cigarette?
You want me to go to Constantinople?
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
At Pre Mathieu's.
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
I am sorry... I have to leave.
You're lawyers.  How can you let this shit go by!  Look!  This?  Nixon can't say this.
For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory.  Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this?  Raising a dirty mouth!
We'll see about that ...
Mr. President, Hunt wants more money. Another hundred-and-thirty thousand.
Mitchell?  Mitchell's ... family.
I'm still not confident we can ride through this.  Some people are going to have to go to jail.  Hunt's not the only problem.  Haldeman let me use the $350,000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments.  Ehrlichman had a role, a big role, in the Ellsberg break-in. And I'm ... uh, I think it's time we begin to think in terms of cutting our losses.
I'm not going to be the scapegoat for this.  Haldeman and Ehrlichman are in just as deep as me.
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
Who's gonna tell Mitchell?
Sure, they did stuff, but nothing like this, Bob.  Forget Watergate, the break-ins, the Enemies list.  You got an attempted firebombing at the Brookings Institution, planting McGovern stuff on the guy that shot Wallace, trying to slip LSD to Jack Anderson.
It's a code or something.
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
Colson doesn't know about it; he's pure as a virgin on this one.  It's just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for.  They were heading to McGovern's office later that night.
I like it.  I like the idea.
Where's Hunt now?
He's begging for a meeting, chief.  He wants to go overseas for awhile.
This is June twentieth?
... Y'know Al, if Hoover was alive none of this would've happened.  He would've protected the President.
May I say something, Mr. President?
You're all set, sir.  Just push this button.  Good night, Mr. President.
Who the fuck does Cox think he is?  I never made a dime from public office!  I'm honest.  My dad died broke.  You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment! They got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about Watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ...
"Victory at Sea," Al ... Henry.  The Pacific Theatre.  Christ, you can almost feel the waves breaking over the decks.
June twenty-third, '72, sir.  The part that's underlined.  Your instructions to Haldeman regarding the CIA and the FBI.
That was civil war.
He works for Colson.  He used him on the Pentagon Papers.  We're trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a White House consultant.  After the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his White House safe.
This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob.  We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own.  Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.
... When we consider the lineup of the world, we find there are 590 million people on our side, 800 million on the Communist side, and 600 million who are neutral.  The odds are 5 to 3 against us ...
... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?
There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars, too many color TVs ...
But, hell, this is nothing compared to Venezuela.  When I was Vice President, Ike sent me down there like a blocking back.  They threw rocks, broke out our windows, almost overturned the car. Read Six Crises, Bob.  Boy, Pat was brave!
She got it, Bob.  A nineteen-year-old college kid ...
Because they're not Americans.
We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing.  It's out of control ...  You might burden just me with this in the future.
I promised Iran to Townsend.
Helms wants Iran or there might be problems.  All of his old CIA buddies are over there making a fortune off the Shah.
... There can be no whitewash at the White House ... two wrongs do not make a right.  I love America.  God bless America and God bless each and every one of you.
Please!  I'll never let you down again, Mother.  Never.  I promise.
We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.
It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.
It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...
What'd you say?
Oh, no, Harold.  He doesn't respond well to humor.  Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ...
Not if I give you all the cards ...
It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.
Mr. Castro.
Mr. Helms, we've lived with Communism in Cuba for ten years ...
I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
Ummm...
My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ...
You'll win the nomination.
Or he'll steal it like his brother. He's a mean little sonofabitch, Edgar ... He had the IRS audit my mother when she was dying in a nursing home.
The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond.
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
Who we working for?
Mein Kampf?
Let's get the fuck out of here, shall we, ladies?
Gentlemen, I tried.  I told Kennedy to go into Cuba.  He heard me and he made his decision.  I appreciate your sentiments.  I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots, but it's nothing I can do anything about.  Now, it's a long drive back to Dallas tonight, and Trini and I have got an early flight tomorrow to New York ...
Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.
It looks like to me we're gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and, Dick, goddamn it, you're going along with it, buying into this Kissinger bullshit -- "detente" with the Communists.  "Detente" -- it sounds like two fags dancing.
Desi's got a point.  What the hell are we gonna do about the Communists right here in our backyard?!
No, Henry.  I don't.
That's triangular diplomacy, gentlemen.
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
Mr. Nixon, it is possible for even a president to go too far.
Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees?
You know, Mr. Chairman, at Harvard I used your writings in my class.
Yes.
I don't know.  He made me see the stars ...
I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman.
How about Kissinger along with him?
We can prosecute the New York Times, go for an injunction ...
Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.
This isn't '48, Dick.  They'll never buy it.
... Use his women.
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
We got the press this time!
We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything!  I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset.  That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing.  I've got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads, we can win this thing.
Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute.
You know, Fred, they sell tickets.
What's in there?
Proud?
There's more ... there's more than just me.  You can't break, my boy, even when there's nothing left.  You can't admit, even to yourself, that it's gone, Al.  Do you think those POWs in there did?
It makes us human ...
We can be happy.  We really can.  We love you, Dick.  The girls and I...
I'll do it.  No more.
Dick, you should call Bobby.
This.  Above all.
Yes ... you know it!  Yes ... I will. Yeah!
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
Anything.
I don't need that, Buddy.  I'm not Jack Kennedy.
Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon!  They want to destroy Nixon!  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that, Buddy?  It's not pretty.
Yes.
No, it isn't.  I won't interfere with you anymore.  I'm finished trying.
I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything.  But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ...
Hey, you know Henry Kissinger -- he's down from Harvard.  On my staff, foreign policy whiz ...
You heard it?
How many a those things you got now?
I am older.
Want a cup?
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
You're discouraged.
Yes.
...I don't know what I do feel like.
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
Hard to believe.
Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
Yes ma'am?
Carla Jean...
...You ride Winston.
But you don't believe it.
What about yours?
...Now that's aggravating.
Yessir. None of the three had ID on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is Mexicans. Was Mexicans.
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?
Don't get hurt.
No.
No.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Not like that. Not like you say.
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
Llewelyn.
Goin' where?
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
What'm I supposed to tell Mama?
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
Llewelyn?
I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --
We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.
Do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?
Yessir?
I can't say.
Hello?
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
I don't know.
This. And the gas.
Is somethin' wrong?
Well... I need to see about closin'.
Yessir.
Now. We close now.
...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?
Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.
What kind of tent?
It's all right.
November the 28th, last year.
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
Yessir.
He killed three men in a motel in Del Rio yesterday. And two others at that colossal goatfuck out in the desert.
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.
Could I get another room.
What about one forty-two.
No, one forty-two.
Half.
...But that won't last.
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
What did you do?
Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
I ask questions. If I get sensible answers then they get to go to America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't. Is there anything about that that you don't understand?
...I meant your food.
...plenty
Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the record yet.
...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
Oww, the arm, the arm!
You're lying!
Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
Well, do something, then, damnit!
Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is ridiculous, I need medical attention!
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
Who are these idiots?
You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
What?
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
That's very kind of you.
Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
You never gave us a chance...
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot.
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
...well, then you ain't got much.
Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
How did you know?
Worse.
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
What are you doing?
It's something I had to do. For David.
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
The Five?
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!
Rosa...
...this is your sweater, right?
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.
No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
That's right.
Now, that's really stupid.
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
What the hell was that, another statement?
I hope you're right...
So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
Joyce was screwing Del.
Do I deserve this? In the twilight of my career, do I deserve this? I don't think so! I've always tried to do what's right. I never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. I'm a professional!  AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I? I'M IN PURGATORY!
We should go.
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
Who's this?
What in the...  What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time!
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here --
This is Betty at twelve.
I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
...and how long did she work here?
Hmm... you two in high school together?
But she wanted more out of life, right?
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
Hmm?
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?
I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway.
God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
Did Chloe crack?
Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
Her show?
'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.
Why don't we bed down out here tonight?
Visit those foreclosin' sonofaguns down at the Indianola Savings and Loan and slap that cash down on the barrelhead and buy back the family farm. Hell, you ain't no kind of man if you ain't got land.
Huh?!
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
Yeah, look at me.
What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar!
You can't display a toad in a fine restaurant like this! Why, the good folks here'd go right off their feed!
Uh, we uh-
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs.
Y'ignorant slope-shouldered sack a guts!  Why we'd look like a buncha satchel-ass Johnnie-Come-Latelies braggin' on our own midget! Don't matter how stumpy! And that's the goddamn problem right there - people think this Stokes got fresh ideas, he's oh coorant and we the past.
I'm sayin' we har this man away.
Vernon Waldrip.
No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
All's well that ends well, as the poet says.
That's not my ring.
That's not my ring.
Well, I'm sorry honey -
Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.
So I borrowed it till I did know!
A million dollars.
An' all my meals for free...
...Nah, that ain't right... I'm thinkin' of...
Fact of the matter - there never was!
We prayed to God and he pitied us!
That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
Oh I remember 'em, colored fellas I believe, swell bunch a boys, sung into yon can and skedaddled.
Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!
Mama said you was hit by a train!
How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it?
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
Come back here, kid!
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
So what're you doing in Seattle?
You... in the Navy?
Why?
Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?
Who's that?
I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
You're pretty funny, Mayo.
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
Zack, we've got to go.
Esther, do you think she's using...  ...birth control?
He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. Do you, Joe?
What's your name, boy?
I want your D.O.R.
You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?
What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get your scuzzy ass up here.
Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
Where are you from, boy?
Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
I know why most of you are here. We're not stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I'm gonna find that out. Understand?
Daddy, I don't want to get into anything with you tonight. I'm tired and I...
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
Is your brother a flyer?
Something tells me you've been here before.
What would you girls like to do? Want to stick around here for a little or... or could I suggest another plan...?
By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now?
Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
And you turned him down??
You little bitch! How could you? Was there ever a baby, Lynette? That's all I want to know! Did you make up that baby, Lynette? Did you??
Yeah? Why're you here?
You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed.
You stayed after all.
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
I'm sorry. I can't sit with you.
What's the matter?
Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know?
So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?
Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
Two bucks a buckle, Perryman. Look at that shine! Boonies'll cost you five.
Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?
Nice, hospitable folks they get around here.  I hope she comes.
Hey, you guys still awake?
What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you?
That isn't true, is it?
I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?
What? You've gotta be kidding!
Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.
Please, Zack -- go back to the barracks!
What if she called the cops?
There is not one thing funny here.
So what the fuck are we supposed to do?!
You should see the look on your face.
Me.  I am.
Yes.
Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
-- posed to mean?
Get the fuck away from me.
Fuck.
Unless Daddy comes back later.
What tables?  I've never seen him before.
Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
Yeah?
'Bout four o'clock.
Somebody called you?
Can we come in?
You don't look so good.
A what?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We can still handle this.  Can we still handle this?
That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, I found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at no point did I say "you" or Raoul," got it?
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
Something's weird.
Ever read any Poe?
Shoulda got an apartment.
What if they get in here?
Morse code?
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
Little Bobby... Just a kid...
No...
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
You got six months to donate to the party, Bobby?
You're Judge right? We need to talk.
I expect to hear from you soon. If Huey Newton takes a crap, I want to know how big it was. Otherwise I'm gonna come looking for you. And I won't be as "friendly" as today.
What are you crazy?
Inspector Brimmer
Hey... what the hell you doing?
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
Check it out... Great huh? I tell you those guys know what time it is. Man I'm with that...
Have to pass on the revolution today man, I got class... But how about tonight, I was gonna check out "Cloud Nine." Just like old times.
You got it. Berkeley?
Yes sir I was.
...at least that takes Bobby Seale off the street...
Well, then we're going to take that power away from those bastards.
That's right brother... listen and learn.
This here's a "Panther Patrol." We see a brother getting busted. We check it out, make sure the pig don't go beating on the man. Brother gets taken downtown, we post bail, hook 'em up with a lawyer.
Alone...
We appreciate your help with this.
You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
You were alright Judge, better than alright. You're what the Party needs. A fighter but also one that's going to school not making the man too nervous.
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
Don't let the cops provoke you. We're there to watch and take badge numbers...
Motherfuckers...
This cool the heat off you any?
It was Sabu killed Cy.
Ain't no one seen him.
Yeah... cop hit me...
You meet those friends of yours in jail too?
Congratulations.
I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?
He shouldn't make light.  That Redcoat should not have been killed.
They're from good stock on their mother's side.
How did this... how did I let this happen?
You're surrendering.
You are familiar with how these things are done.  In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status.
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
Thank you.
Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels.
Civility is a secondary virtue.  It is superseded by duty.
Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
Have you seen any Redcoats?
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.
Father...
Did your father teach you humility?
Is it?
Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
Lord Cornwallis is brilliant.  His weakness is that he knows it.
Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured.
Stay the course... your mother used to say that to me when I'd get drunk or lose my temper.
That's why it was four years between you and Thomas.  It took me that long to regain her respect.
He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.
An American nation.  Colonel Lee, with your permission?
We saw.
Where is he now?
Goodbye, Francis.
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
How far away?
That bad?
Put those away.
Father, I saw a post rider at the house.
Father... I killed those men...
I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy!
Please hurry.
Then why do I have to go to bed?
The one that goes into the woods--sure.
Not yet...how much further is it?
Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?
But--
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
It's funny, all right.
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
You want to rest a bit before you start?
Doesn't look like they last long.
But--
I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But...
No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?
Can I have another one?
You and this old Indian rag-man--
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on.
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
Let her go. It's cool.
And Buckaroo Banzai.
You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face.
I'm going to try to do better.
My dory.  The Jolly Mon.  Where is it?
How does he do that?
What's in your head, boy?
You must swear by the Holy Bible.
You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse.  Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
Why don't I want to do this?
Now?
Maid or not, it fits you.
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
If I had known --
I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
That was before I met one, of course.
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
Say again?
Blast it, I'm already awake!
We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
This dock is off-limits to civilians.
Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?  You two weren't invited?
None?  Very well.  You rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go on the account, do a little honest pirating.
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
We had time to get to know each other.
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?
Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
Not without my effects.
Come aboard.
It's still against the law.
I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
No.
Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship.  I'll keep 'em busy.
Are you certain this is the right way?
Jack!
You've seen the Black Pearl?
I think he's telling the truth.
He's still breathing.
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
But --
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
This is our world, Susan, and once you realize that, you will understand that the only place our path can end is on the throne of heaven.  Science is the quest for divine perfection.
... plastic.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
Icky!  What's happening?
A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
Do you think she will give us the designs?
It will be an ascension.
Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I estimate at least another six hours.
Excellent work, Dr. Nebbleman.  You have outdone yourself.
Haw-haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
You want to tell me what I'm looking for?
He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
Really?  What have you been doing?
Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man.
Do you ever wonder what happened to us, Susie?
Yeah.
We'll see?  What does that mean?
Why?
Susan!
Just look at it!
You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
Just like old times.
Uh oh.  I remember that temper.
What's wrong?
I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
That's going to fit me?
Argon's private lab.
Run, Daniel!  Get out of here!
You saved my life.
You!  I remember you!
Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.
That's impossible.
Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
I could have you fired right now.
Don't mind Mother.
May I use your telephone?
That's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge.
Really?
Oh, Mother!
A little? Sure, I'll be right up.  He's all right. I like him.
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.
Ah-ah-ah!
Fine. Have a seat.
This way.
Give my regards to your managing editor.
How's that?
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
Yeah, little Gloria.
Come on, get going, get going!
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
What play?
Well, I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooey  Let me know when you're quitting.
No?
You're my what?
Did you take anything out of those pants?
Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
I think I understand, sir. You mean you want me to go?
He's probably very tired. You see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.
Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.
Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.
I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.
Okay.
Then how do you expect to write about it?
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
Who was that?
What did he want?
It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this?  The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?
A statement? Good.
Hello, Smith.
Thanks. May I sit down?
What is it, Smythe?
Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels[3] will upset me.
Some bicarbonate - quick!
Double-strength!
Yes - the worm!
There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh?  Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake!  Now, as a Smith to a Smythe
You try it.
Found no skeletons?
It's haunted just the same.
Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.
What?
Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
Have you got any make up?
How was your day?
It goes away ... It'll go away.
What?
Sure is pretty.
... Why?
Oh.  I can't.
Oh God! Are we in that episode?
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
I think I've got something to say.
THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
It's not in ME.
Dan! Arrest them!
Oh my God.
Noooooo!
Oh God.
I don't believe this.
No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
I could like kill a guy with these things.
You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED you.
David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
You're reading?
D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
No. She really liked you.
This thing works. We could go home right now.
Hi.
How?
What do we do?
I like calling you David.
You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
EXCUSE ME?
OW!
Now Buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. And if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. Well, not forever--lemme think ...  Five year sentence ... Carry the three ... That comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down.
There's worse places.
Have you cooked the burgers?
Bud ...
No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
Well don't you?
It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV tonight?
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
Well, I can't talk though --
What's the listing?
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
Why?
It's not cool?
Are you gonna do it?
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
I'll leave then, I'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious question:
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
Why's it here?
Hey. What are you doing?
No.
No, I mean, what city, what state are you in?
Really?
Yeah....do you do well, do you make alotta money?
So.....are you stroking it, yet, honey?
Well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me?
I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it.
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
You have trouble, financial trouble?
Hello?
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
There's a piano in the street.
Hi.
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
That's great -- Hawaii. I was thinking about going there.
It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --
Who is it?
...really? That's nice...are you lying?
Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
....yeah....
No I didn't say that.
Your portable reed organ....the piano.
Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
Are you learning how to play it?
Oh that's great.
Yeah.
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
I just wanted to make sure.
Where you married?
It's so nice.
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
I know. I know. I know. I just wanna chew your face and scoop out your beautiful, beautiful eyes with an ice cream scooper and eat 'em and chew 'em and suck on 'em. Fuck.
I forgot about that.
Yeah.
It's a plastic, yeah.
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
Ok.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
Hi, this is Janice The Operator, who's this?
It's just for verification through the credit card company.
Who is this?
YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.
I'll say whatever I want --
Sorry about that.
How you doin' Barry?
How's business?
Good morning, Barry....
No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
No thanks.
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?
What happened?
I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.
Where you been?
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.
This is Barry.
Yes I am.
Ok.
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
What did you say?
I'll go pay for my car.
Yeah.
Are you ready?
I think he's weird, but that's me.
Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.
If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories --
"One day, Fanchon's first client was a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting each and every follicle..."
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness --
And --?
I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
If you only mean to dupe me again --
He can't do that to me.
What the devil --
Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior --
Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit --
Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT!
If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive.
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
What on earth would that require?
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
For fuck's sake, Abbe! What am I to do? Police my readers as you police me? Suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? Would you condemn the Bible? I think not!
Don't confuse one organ with another --
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first to welcome you to Charenton --
I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
Besides, every wholesome thing he might desire, he has at Charenton. A library, filled with the world's great books, music lessons, watercolor exercises --
Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?
On the contrary. Let me take up this matter with the Marquis myself --
He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --
It was fiction, of course.
It was not inspired by circumstance.
You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.
As for the author... shoot him.
But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor an... aggressive... course of treatment.
Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
I'll pass the word on, then.
At last she arrives, my hard-won bride! Hurry, my child, and scurry inside. There you'll find such treasures await you; Marzipan and meringue to sate you!
Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid it grows!
My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.
What have they done to you now?
My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe...
The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
"By the time you read this, we'll be long gone; bound for England or points beyond..."
You're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton...
Don't toy with me, Doctor.
I am eternally in your debt.
Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.
Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?
Doesn't that please you?
Of being found out. Of not being a genius
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
God, these parties are the worst
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.
Quite. And this is why I came to visit. Have you heard about this CITIZEN KANE picture?
And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.
There. That's right.
Then you explain it to me?!
Miss Parsons, I have one additional question for you.
Why did we not know about this sooner?
I want blood
"Well, if you got drunk to talk to me about Miss Alexander, don't bother. I'm not interested. I've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it? All right, if that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice. It's obvious the people prefer Jim Gettys to me."
This is the chance you've been waiting for, boy. Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!
But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! - - no one wants to see that.
How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes
Sigmund Freud?
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . "How big is it, all told? The estate?
Oh Christ...
Mank-
I remember a man who wrote I He was a brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and insight--
Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years--
Fuck you--
It doesn't have to be
So, who is he? We have to know him.
How?
Why her?
The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.
I want you back
No, but I can imagine. What am I today? A "puny upstart" or a "spoiled dilettante" -- no, she wouldn't know how to spell that
Who owns this town? Who runs every goddamn studio? The tribe, baby. These fuckers hear the word "Jew" and they start sweating. Like Ester Williams' pool they start sweating.
Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's Irish for fuck's sake--
If he had known about KANE before you made it, you'd be dead already.
You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss Davies! I just saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine picture!
Yes
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
Pardon?
This isn' t some kinda fucking game! You know how many people RKO employs?! You know how many people depend on what we do for a living?!
Oh God. . .
It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As towering virtues in combat--
We're from...
All right. I don't have to hear any more. I think I understand what happened. I understand it was your brother's wife and there was probably a misunderstanding. I'm not sayin' Salvy shouldn't have acted the way he did. But, Joey, you don't raise your hands. You don't do that kind of thing. This time we forget about it but no more after this. You understand?
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
What's up, Colonel?
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
This looks done.
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
What's wrong?
That's what I'm sayin'. You shouldn't even think like that. It's crazy.
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
Jack, I got no gloves.
Harder.  Take the towel off.
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there.
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
Huh?
You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
I just weighed myself -- I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place.
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.
Screw you, Jack.
Whatever you touched, that's good now.
You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight.
Nine o'clock.
Now, touch me...  ...here.
I was just...
Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
You're not interested in him?
Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?
That he's got a pretty face.
You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
I went out.
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?
I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
The kids are sleeping.
I said, let's go.
Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
This is the baby sitter.
This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.
I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it.  Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife.
She never left the apartment --
Who said they left then?
I know what you told me! She went in to get evidence, and she came out with it.
In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?
This is Wednesday.
Hello.
Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
Hello.
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
I predicted it.
That's abnormal.
Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause.  What is it? You have a fight?
It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties.
Look, Mr. Jefferies. I'm not educated. I'm not even sophisticated. But I can tell you this -- when a man and a woman see each other, and like each other -- they should come together -- wham like two taxies on Broadway. Not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle.
Keep your mind off her.
He and his wife splitting up?
Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies. I'll see you tomorrow.
Huh?
Mrs. Thorwald?
When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?
Yes.
It is something really important, Jeff?
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
And you love life?
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
What would you think of starting off with dinner at the "21"?
Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne -- just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the "21" for lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered dinner. Then two Fall showings -- twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward -- we're trying to get his next show.  Then I had to dash back and change.
Make the one you want.
Lisa, simmer down -- will you?
And it's deflating to find out that the only way I can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine. I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
Don't you ever have any problems?
What makes you think something's wrong with her?
Maybe she died.
Lisa, please!
There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!
What are you getting at?
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
Something on your mind, Lisa?
Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
I hate funny exit lines.
Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor."
Something's in there. Those flowers have been taken up, and put back again.
Wasn't that close?
A man is assaulting a woman at one two five west ninth street. Second floor rear. Make it fast.
Steady Marlon!
You know something?
Hey, he's real abstract and different.
Sure.  It's fine.
You see any cops?
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
What time is it?
You can't protect me.
Mother--
You thought I was Mom?
Yeah!  Shh!
Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
Hey--I want to ask you something.
Just give me a direct answer!  You going to stop me from going, Dad?
Except yourself!
He depended on me.
You sure?
Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
No!
Frank?  I'm frightened.
Who's there?  Anyone there?
Frank!
She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house.
Do you know why you shot those puppies, John?  Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
You remember me?
What's your name!
You scared?
I got to go in.  You better get home too.  Hey--what?
It's me!
Hey where'd you go?
Isn't it crazy?
Isn't he schizoid?
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
What you run out on me for!  What you leave me alone for?
I don't want you for my father!
You promised to give it back.
I'm sorry.
What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
No.
Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
That why you moved from the last town? 'Cause you were in trouble? You can talk about it if you want to--I know about it anyway. Routine check.
You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?
They think I'll make friends if we move.  Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
Where's Dawson High School?
Yeah--why--
Goodbye!  See you!
You still pretty upset?
I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again.
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
Sure.  Lots of times.
Where you going?
Why don't we just rent it for the season?
You can't talk underwater!
What?
Why?
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
You smell like baby powder.
After he tried to shoot you?
Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
She's being called for.
Didn't you forget something?
So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams.
Read a lot about you, Nick.
Is this him!?
Gabriel, you promised!
Searching for a money man...
Gabriel!
Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
Ashley, Jesus --
I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.
...the truck driver...
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
I'M NOT NICK!  You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me!
My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
No, Nick, no --
They changed the layout -- whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--
I thought we'd have a few more days.
They've never done a robbery?
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
He wants to see your map.
How are we gonna do this, Nick?
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
I saved your life.
Merry Christmas, Rudy.
Who are you now.
So you could get down her chimney.
You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus.
Be more specific.
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
Hey, it's... been two years --
So what the hell good are you...
They won't recognize me.
You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.
A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
Start singing.
Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access.
So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.  You need six.
You gotta be kidding me.
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
...so where is he?
Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?
How long ago was your makeover?
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
You want that for here or to go?
Monsters in the gelatin...
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
She's using a new perfume.
Oh.
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
GUARD! GUARD!
Jesus, Rudy --
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
Ash... Ashley...
Tell her... I'll be there ...
Tell Ashley... I...
Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
Start talkin
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
That I should've picked you up?
Seymour Scagnetti.
The cops were there waitin' for us!
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?
But what is this?
Tell me more about Cabot.
Jesus Christ!
I'm sorry.
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
Aren't you?
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
What're you talkin' about?
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
C'mon, throw in a buck.
I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country. It's the one job basically any woman can get, and make a living on. The reason is because of tips.
Gun shot.
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
Want a smoke?
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
I got the diamonds.
I got 'em, all right?
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
So what is it?
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
Is that supposed to be funny?
You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
And that's more important than finding Lednov?
What's she doin' runnin' around the country at night.
And this is Helen Carter.
Our kind of women?
And this is Helen Carter.
But you eat, don't you?
Like what?
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
But the nearest shelter's the Wyatt ranch and that's maybe five hours away.
We can't stay here!
I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.
Are we leaving?
So grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance.
I won't have you fighting over me.
Some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. I don't blame you because I understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. You want your women on pedestals. But they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up.
That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
I -- lost something.
That's right.
That's Lednov!  We come along here.
They sure must have been travelin'. This keeps up we can start a store.
Oh... that's the time you went away.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
You'll live.
You can light the lamp.  I'm sure glad it's you. We were afraid those killers might come back.
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know you had a daughter.
I can't take her with me.
It isn't that --
I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here where I belong.
She mustn't -- don't you let her --
And you're all alone.
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.
With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
It isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of.
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
-- Gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. Cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. What do you think of that?
How do you know who we are?
You're so nice.
Gee, I can't.
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
How about California?
Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you.
You don't know what it is to be sorry.
No, I won't let you do it.
That's it.
And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
He's right. I should go first.
Where's Shorty?
You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
Dude, somebody's on the rag.
Let's get outta here.
We should act out our inner most fantasies.
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
There's something I really want to share with you.
Cindy, about this whole friendship thing...
No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got there I guess it was gone.
Oh, right.
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
Hanson, please.
This can't be happening?
Would you like me to help you pass them back?
What the hell are you doing?
What are we gonna do?
Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
Are you?
Professor, what's the history of this house?
Got a problem with that?
I take it you're not mad at me.
I think she's starting to suspect something?
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
Would you please focus?
My God! Is she dead?
Professor, I think you should see this.
The image there.
Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
The Professor might have everyone else fooled, but I know who the real brains of the operation is.
Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it?
Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.
You never could feel your legs.
Father.
Remember, don't ask her too many questions.
This part removes the sense of humor.
What a bitch!
I wouldn't give ya a nickel.
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
How about Mrs. Ackerman? We both hate her!  Should she be the next victim?
Just a little, please. Bad for the teeth.
Sorry, ma'am.
Bye, Birdie.  Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
I got somebody you could run over, Mother!
Home Sweet Home! Everything's fine, kids!
Shhhh..
Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!
I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week.
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
Hello.
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?
It's him!
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
Man, that one made me puke!
Are we leaving?
SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
What is it, Betty?
I'll take this instead.
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
I don't like this.
The acceptance of a secret is an obligation and in this case my dear, the obligation carried with it the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret. You understand that don't you?
Then, you also understand that you must die.
Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
I'll give you a check.
About forty-five dollars.
Why, Mary --
How's Miss Jacqueline?
It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
What were you talking about?
And that was all?
Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding.
We're not exactly strangers, Mary. Jacqueline spoke about you often. I suppose she told you about me,
The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
You can't make it your life's work looking for Jacqueline.  ) You'll have to do other things... live...get some enjoyment out of life. I hope you'll let me help you.
This is about another murder  a woman at Fifty Second Street
Yes, of course  but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.
I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.
The people at the restaurant?
She's got to be found. That's the first step. She's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police.
Do you think he knows about this?
Let her know what?
I don't know.
At least you knew about Dr. Judd.
It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.
I went as a detective. I found out that Mrs. Redi reads the same books as Dr. Judd.
But who is Judd, a psychiatrist. It's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies. But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor --?
That's it. And this figure --she traced it. The book I saw at the library had been marked "perfect" by the library inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since.
It's not a searchlight  it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince - not stars --
It isn't that -- you said, "have to go." What could compel you --
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
Not I - I am alive, yet every hope I had is dead,  Death can be good. Death can be happy.. If I were really dying I could speak like Cyrano - "My courage like a white plume"  and all the other lovely words with which he greeted death. Then perhaps you might understand,
Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?
What was she to you?
I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
It's my cloven hoof. It trips me up sometimes.
Yes. You could become a country wife -- fool around with petunias and pullets.
I know the others -- Redi, Fallon, Leo, Bruns. But I would never have guessed it of you, Natalie.
Perhaps, Natalie, this is a bargain you're offering me --I am being allowed to join -- to buy safety by betraying Jacqueline -- is that it?
Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
I was a great dancer...
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
This is the most amusing thing I have ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it  your failure with Jacqueline. Has she returned to her husband?
Mrs. Redi, there's one thing -with Jacqueline gone, how do you carry on the business? What do you do with the receipts? How do you sign checks--?
Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.
No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.
That was quick.
Have you ever been on television?
You play an instrument?
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
How long has it been since you've seen John?
Would you mind?
I know that I just don't feel a connection with very many people, so I don't waste time with people I don't feel one with.
Why is that?
What?
My therapist said that --
Of course not.
So since I've never had sex with you, by your own advice I shouldn't accept your advice.
Donna?
Yes.
You just ask them questions?
John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".
You know?
Why didn't you tell me?
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
Do you talk to him?
No.
That's correct.
Her name was Elizabeth.
I've told you.
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
But you're planning to be?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
Like maybe a big part?
Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.
Because.
I can't tell you like this.
I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting --
I want to touch you.
Tuesday. I had a late lunch.
I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.
Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?
Where did you go when you left here?
You son of a bitch!!
God damn you!!
Do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
What do you mean?
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
What do you mean, like physically?
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
I hate my sister.
I just want to know what he looks like, is all.
Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.
I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.
Because I never got around to it.
Yes, I did.
In front of him, Ann, yes.
I feel like I do.
So what's my share of the dress?
I get real busy between two and four.
Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't.
No, I touched me.
Well, why would she want a sun dress? She's got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins.
The extrovert.
Nope. I think the man is a liar.
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
I am now recording. Tell me your name.
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
Were you disappointed?
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
I have a friend coming in from out of town, I'll probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days.
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
Who said I was jealous?
Afraid of getting caught?
Not today. I've got other plans.
How about inviting me over to dinner?
Why not?
Who?
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.
He said immediately.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
Jesus!
It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come.
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? What's happened?
Can I call you at the office?
Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
Yes?
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
GOT THE HOT FLUSH SYMPTOMS AND I'M FEELING FREAKY
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
Sank you!  Velcome!  Sank you!
You got it!
Infantile regression.
Why Janet?
Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled.  If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?
We're the experts.
A 'stately pleasure home' indeed.
Oh, Oliver.  What are we going to do?
I'M LOOKING FOR LOVE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR COMPASSION
YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR IMPROVEMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT
I'd forgotten.
Oh, Harry.  What are we going to do?
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
Dentonvale...say, that's for...  I'm sorry to hear that, Janet.  Look I'm going to let you through, but keep it to yourself, otherwise...
I NEED SOME
Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you.
You are the most desirable creature that ever walked.
HE!!??  How dare this person take advantage of my weakness.
CRIMINAL
Hi!  Macy Struthers -- co-host on the F. F. show.
THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
And none of them worked?
She walks in beauty...
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
The fuck was that?
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
Are you there? Miles?
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
Glass or bottle?
Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious.
Great. You look great.  You both do.
Highliner, please.
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
Don't open that now. It's warm.
Yeah.
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
And?
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.  Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
You know, you could work in a wine store.
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
We should have driven.
Sure I know Maya.
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
Have you no shame?
She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
We're on.
So what should I wear?
Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
And don't drink too much. I don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the dark side.
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
What?
I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay?
Been checking your messages?
Huh.
Don't come over the top. Stay still.
We're on.
I said okay?
Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?
You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
Do you like them?
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
That's thoughtful.
Fucking chick's married.
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
So what the fuck were you thinking?
Hey, Jack. Jack.
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
Well. That about does it.
This is good. Little hints of clove.
So what's your novel about?
Oh. You mean... today?
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
So what do you think?
Where's Jack?
Huh.
Oops. Sorry.
You talked to Wendy?
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
No.
There's dust in it.
Does it hurt?
...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her.
Five. The five longest.
Explain noises.
This guy got on the roof in like a second.
It's probably picking up another baby monitor.
Should we turn off the lights?
Merrill!
It's getting stronger.
We might lose the signal.
So the aliens can't read our minds.
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of the book --
They'll read our minds!
It's the strangest thing Father.
Second thing this week I can't explain.
Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
You can't describe him at all? Don't you think that's find of odd?
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
And three weeks.
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
Is that him?
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now.
...Gotta go...
This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.
McKendrick's men got him.
Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.
I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him.
Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends.
South of here, past Chimayo.
Women?
It's not going to be easy.
Where is Rae?
He acted bravely out there, Hannah. Just bad luck his getting hit. Could have been any one of us.
Never will again.
Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.
Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?
Rae, all we got is each other.
Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
Why come to me?
What's stopping you?
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
I thought we talked about that.
Nifty.
It's the only place I'm happy.
You really are a gambler.
I've got a place I can hide her.
Stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. Treat him right.
From what I've seen, Paden doesn't care much about money.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.
Christ --  Elaine, I know how it looks but...  ... it would mean a lot to Viktor if you'd go with him to the Oscars. If you won't do it for him, please do it for me.
Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
God, Viktor.  Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
The public decides who's on that list.
I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".
Why not?
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Whatever.  I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
Well, something has to be done about this budget.  It's completely unrealistic.  You allowed nothing for limousine service.
Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
Not today.  She's learning her lines.  You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
I'll tell you what.  I know how much this means to you.  I'll try to get her to plug the film.  I'm not promising anything but maybe she'll do a talk show -- taped.
I just read somewhere --
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
-- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --
Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend?
Thank you!  I don't know how you did it but thank you.
Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.
God, it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that.
Thank God for you, Faith.  I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.  You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.
You look so, so...
What?... What did you say?
Well, no one could accuse you of being over-exposed, Simone.  Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
No, I'm okay.
Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are just an option.
Hal, what are you doing?
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
Is she here?
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
You have to see her.
-- Flesh is weak.
You already do.  But my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer.  The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years.
An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
"Straw God" changed my life.
She still with Kent?
Not quite how I imagined it --
She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?
You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
-- I know, I don't know anything.
I love you, Lainey.
There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
Do I know you?
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
So they're probably here.  You might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world, but I'm not buying it. What's really behind this Simone woman?  The public has a right to know.  Why is she staying out of sight?  And why the hell is she with you?  I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Viktor, but you're not exactly Cecil B. DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky.  Are you holding her hostage?  Are you some kind of Svengali?
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
It's bogus.  You used an old library shot for the background.
That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.
Is it a jamming device?
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
It's a hotel.
-- Nicola!  How was your massage?
Would you like me to read?
You could play the lead.
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Hi.
Good morning, Simone.
A star is...
Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
You did create me.
--My God.
Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them.
Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while.  You're my very first client back.
And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.
We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
Know what?
What'd you write?
Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
When they get mad, it gets cold.
Can I ask you then?
I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists that are exceptional--
You weren't a paper champion.
Dr. Crowe?
Just help.
I wish I were somewhere else.
You were great in the play, Cole.
Where is she?
I don't like people looking at me like that.
Excuse me?
Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Your pa's waiting for you up at the house.
You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
Yo. "Billy Bob". Was I two beats behind, or what?
Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?
Listen to me, you banjo-dueling, country ass hayseed... I want my Nikes and I want them now!
Rod... I have to get back to my job.
You have a strong unfufilled desire.
How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
Come on --
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.
Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye.
"Peggy-Sue" --
So... what does it do?
"Old Macdonald... had --"
I'll be gone again tomorrow.
-- And keep your eyes on the road.
You know what they say about men who need big guns...
Asphyxiation. Choked to death on a ham sandwich. Next.
Yes!
You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.
Name something.
I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --
How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork?
Getting ready.
Suzie... No.
Listen to me --
Like your guitar break.
-- Where have you two been?
Someone better tell Mac.
Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
He's a fucking Martian?!
Looks like a chipmunk.
Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Hey there, Chief.
Megan Halesy' little sister.
My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow. Was then, even more so now. I'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.
Welcome home.
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
Where'd he go?
I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
But you could get killed, right?
Where you from?
Christ, what channel are we on?...
You know this guy, don't you?
By stealing my car?
Yeah.
Mississippi's the other way!
Let's hit it.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
My very words.
Whadda we have to do -- kidnap the Pope?
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
How long's this gonna take?
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
Also boring.
Liquid gold.
You know how to drive one of these things?
Bandit?
My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers.  Hear that? Where's his chow?
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
Never mind. It's nothing.
You're coming up to the scale house.
Pop, a K-Whopper's worth seventy thou.
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
Bandit two, you read me?
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
Is your security team armed?
Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
No.
You investigating those murders out at the lake?
If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.
Man, that's great.
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself.
What happened?
Yeah, we've been through that.
D'you talk to'm?
Do you want me to say I did it?
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
FUCK YOU!
They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!
-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...
So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart?
It's the last place they'd look.
Where's Israel?
I can't discuss --
...When did you know all this?
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?
The agents of that era are all dead and gone, history had defaulted to fable... until now. You can imagine the shock this sent through the corridors of power in D.C. Heller's op predates the second world war. That's over sixty years of intel. Do you know how valuable that could be? The man's a treasure trove.
...So you knew all this and yet y--
I'll overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place. You've been fully debriefed. Now I want you to return to D.C. immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter. I mean it. It's closed.
You got clicks, anything?
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
... Jesus... what for?
Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
Why?
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
What's wrong?
Girl one of these fools has an FBI badge on him! Is this the one that was doing the inspection?
What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of some sort.
I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
It's changing characteristics.  It's solidifying taking on weight.
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
I'm not sure.  It started with Gibarian.  He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown.  I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there.  By this time, we were getting visitors, too.  He was desperately trying to figure it out.  Day and night.  Who was she?
Probably.
Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable, how you equivocate!  You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen!  This is happening, Kelvin.  Wake up.
Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you.  She will die.  Then what will you do?
Don't.
I don't know.  I can't be alone.
Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
You go home.
What do you remember?
Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up.  I was a threat.  Now I know why.  She was afraid she'd be seen.  That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right?  I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on.  I guess that's part of the reason why --
What happened to us, exactly?
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
Sartorius wants to destroy it.
What are you talking about?
You're the coward.
I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it.
How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this?
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm staying here with you.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
How can you be here...
He won't do it.
It's terrific Win.
I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning.  Identify him.
He said he'd kill me.
Open the door, will you?
Stop being nuts!
I do care about you!
You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  A fuckin' joke?
Are you okay?
Claire...
They guys treatin' you all right?
I'd miss my life...
You don't have to, now.
Say goodbye, Mike.
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
My ass if falling.
My ass is falling.  It is.
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
For how long?
I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  What took you?
She's got to identify him.
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
He doesn't want to sleep here.  Neither do I.  It's not my house anymore.
I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.
What about when she identifies him?!
I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?
Let's go.  We're takin' her home!  Move it!  Get the cars!
We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
You in this with me?
Yes.
... Hard?
No, I will not step outside.
You're here 'til what time?
You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said.
What!  What kind of pathetic line is that?
We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons.
Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
Peter-- you took this picture?
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
Yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
Lizzy!
Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
Jesus Christ.
I bet you don't think I appreciate you, Parker.  I do.
I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
Oh, that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye.
An even five I throw in the jacket.
Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
Are you quite finished?
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
Don't misquote Othello at me. Besides, you'd have to care about somebody to strangle them.
Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
I... I like you.  A lot.
You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
Toxic dumps, huh.
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
In this obsolete little cyclotron, I'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th Century.  With more power, I could--
You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
Kid, you were terrific.  Max Reiss, novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah, skip it.  Question is, can you do it again?
Why? It is a wrestling match, or
Where'd you get the clown suit?
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
You're sure you're all right.
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become whatever it is you are?
A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...
Up here, Docky Ocky!
They never caught on.
What's wrong with him?
How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
What are you looking at him for?  Any objections, Sefton?
Next we're going to auction off your department store -- and your stable.
Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
What some brandy?
You won't get off that cheap.
I am Lieutenant Dunbar.
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
I didn't do it. I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
It is.
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
Very well. If you insist on details. I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb. Good day, sir.  You will forgive me for receiving you like this?
Jawohl?
Shut up, Animal!
I'll kill you, Harry -- so help me!
You can say that again!
Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!
Look at me! I'm your baby!  Get a load of that blonde one! Built like a brick Kremlin!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
Animal! When the war's over, remember I told you I'd fix you up with Betty Grable!
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
No, Animal.
Easy, Animal! Easy!
Don't you remember, Animal? A chicken lays those things.
Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
Why don't we just look in those footlockers?
Do Grable.
I'll open mine now.
Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!
Good evening, Sergeants.  A bit dank in here, isn't it?... Where is the Baracken-Fuehrer?
...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
What are you going to do?
What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.
Why the south latrine?
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
What radio?
If I were you, Sefton, I'd eat that egg some place else. Like for instance under the barrack.
Says me.
Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
You could use a new one yourself.
And what's that crack supposed to mean?
I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
The what?
Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
We have no radio.
Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
All right, gentlemen! We will now all go outside for a little gymnastic and take some shovels and undig the tunnel which you digged.
My grandmother's ear-muffs.
That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
It's working.
Where is he now?
Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-
Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.
Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
Well?
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
These are my children...my children.
Well, may we have a look around?
Antonia?
Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
Keep her together until I get back.
Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle.  A little trick I picked up from the Borg.
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
Sir?
There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
Maybe they're not out there.
I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.
Doctor Soran?
Doctor, we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then-
You must think I'm quite the madman.
I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one.  Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago.
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
Worf, prepare a spread of photon torpedoes. We'll have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak.
Status!
Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!
Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge.
Calm yourself, Bones.
You did great, Bones... Just great.
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
Could it be Spock's?
All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
My readings indicate great instability.
What is it?
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
Did your collaborator know?
Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.
Captain... the logical alternative is obvious... beaming down to the surface is permitted...
Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
Mr. Scott?
What's wrong?
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
What happened...?
My God...
My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
The word, sir?
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.
We are clear and free to navigate.
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
Would you look at that?
Will you be able to handle that...?
Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --
Yours...?!
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.
I say again: Grissom, this is Enterprise. Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik. Come in!
Genesis, I want it.
Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...
I -- saw no future --
He asked you not to grieve...
... The needs of the many outweigh...
Sir, may I suggest --
I ordered no interruptions.
How can you tell that?
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
Commander, these are some of the most famous people in Starfleet! Admiral Kirk, my God!
But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists?
Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there!
Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?
Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
Twenty-two, eighty-three...
It never rains but when it pours --
Khan could be down there!
But what if they went -- nowhere?
Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved.
Now that's what I call a meal.
Hours instead of days, Saavik; now we have minutes instead of hours --
... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant --
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life...
Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
I didn't expect anything.
What are <u>you</u> looking at?
Steady on course. All systems normal.
They're still running with shields down.
At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE! Why can't you?
Tactical!
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
I don't know you. But you. I never forget a face. Mister Chekov, isn't it?  I never thought to see your face again.
Scotty -- what's left?
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
Mr. Scott on discrete.
Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
And who is this?
Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?
Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
I would not presume to debate you.
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?
Not enough against their shields.
The prefix code?
Affirmative, Admiral.
What IS working around here?
Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.
... the good of the few...
In my quarters, Uhura.
I failed to resolve the situation.
That was a little joke.
This is damned peculiar.  Yellow alert.
But the damage report -- we were immobilized...
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
That was close --
Hold your course. Look sharp...
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
Admiral on the bridge!
Mr. Sulu... The shields!
Admiral on the bridge --
Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen.
I do this because I was there,
I would accept that as an axiom.
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
Wake up, man, wake up!
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.
You, ah...  You present the appearance of a man with a problem.
Who are you? Doctor Adams was supposed to assist me.
What's your degree in, dentistry?
What's causing that!?
Find it?
How long?
All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?
My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.
My name?
Go ahead. Stun me.
Status report, Admiral!
"Neutralized?" How?
Can you protect us?
They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.
You sure you won't change your mind?
Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!
Memory problems, too.
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
No, ma'am. No dipshit.
He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
Do you trust me?
Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
Well, "Admiral," that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard.
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
If we keep going up, they'll catch us!
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
Hey! -- Where you going?!
Thank you, Admiral.
Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
Come on, fellah -- speak up!
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
What else did you learn from your mind meld?
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
Ready sir.
Systems report.  Communications?
Admiral, I am receiving whale songs.
I'll have bearing and distance for you, sir.
Any luck...?
Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.
Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...
Admiral! There be whales here!
Full power, sir.
Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
If you'll follow me, Professor --
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira.  Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
The craftsmanship is extraordinary.
When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...
Jak'tahla?
Mother and son. You arranged this...?
But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.
Don't you ever get tired?
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
I have to go home now.
Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills...
Incomplete, I might add.
Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...
I'm showing fresh air  behind this calcite formation, Captain...
Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...
It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?
I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
I want our guests to depart as quickly a etiquette allows. I'll ask Worf to delay his return to DS9 so he can join us. We're going to stop by sector four-four- one on our way to the Goren system.
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
Implants bothering you?
Funniest thing, Captain. There wasn't anything wrong with my implants. There was something right with my eyes. When Doctor Crusher removed the ocular connections, she found the cells around my optic nerves...
If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.
That's your expert opinion?
I wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver...
I don't think they believe us.
The tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds...
The purpose being I intend to shove it down the Son'a's throat.
What's inside that nebula cluster?
I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord...
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
He's activated a transport inhibitor.
Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?
Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?
All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.
Wine, women and song.
It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
Why don't you try sitting up?
What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher...  Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
All hands. Battle stations!
The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?
Good hunting. Hayes out.
Montana.  Energize.
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
It's Cochrane.
He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
There is a perimeter alert. A ship has entered sensor range.
Can you configure it?
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
I have helm control.
Who are you?
No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I.
Juice?
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
Where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself?
The Vulcans should be out there right now. We need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're going to get their attention.
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?
Did you need something?
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
I'd say you already have.
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
Captain...?
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.
Return to our own time?
Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?
A ship-wide decompression has been initiated!
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
We have to stop them from sending that message.
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
Even Data?
Uh, Jim...
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
Are you carrying a surgeon?
Retire.
I was nervous -
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
It takes a lot of effort.
For insubordination.
As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
Mr. Chekov, take us forward, thrusters only, one half impulse power...
Klingon blood.
Aye, sir.
Send to commander Enterprise: "We stand ready to assist you. Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior." Attach our co-ordinates.
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
An accident wasn't good enough...
This is incredible -
As you were. Lieutenant...?
Kronos, sir?
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
According to my information, today.
Lieutenant, I am pleased to see you.  The Lieutenant is the first Vulcan to be graduated at the top of her class as the Academy.
Never been this close.
Where?
The Klingons have a new weapon: a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked. She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
Control tower, reading, Sir.
Gorkon's own man??
You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan.
Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
In nineteenth century France, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden shoes - called SABOTS - into the gears to stop them. Hence the word SABOTAGE.
Sir?
I have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --
Praxis?
That could take hours!
And if they're still in place?
Sulu's giving us his position and telling us he's standing by...
And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?
I don't think Starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament.
Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
Fuzzy face is gone.
Why?
Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
No. I must deactivate you.
When was he... created?
He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would "miss you."
My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.
A weapon.
Alacrity would be appreciated, Commander.
Do you think this is a wise course of action?
"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
You have a red shirt.
Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
What purpose does this serve?
It appears to be...  ... an arm.
May I have this dance?
It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
I'm going to miss you.
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
You're not here.
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?
Open a channel.
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
What's he doing?
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
Deanna, on my mark.
Sir, we're being hailed.
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...  Naked.
Why don't they answer our hails?
Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols  -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are.
Strength in numbers?
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.
Anything.
I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.
What are you doing?
Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does.  Or maybe Ill snap its ugly head off.
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
Yes.
Report!
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
This is a mistake.
No -- this is wasting time.
How long?
But surely...
Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!
You must learn patience, Commander. Do you know where I learned it? In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a Romulan guards whip and you'll soon understand patience.
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.
Mike, call for back-up.  Benny, you all right?
Gate three. It's boarding now.
What do you do?
Do you have children?
What do you think of America?
Where did you stop last?
Where did you stop last?
None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
Hello George.
We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?
Please...
What?
Dashboard.
Money.
Smile... good?
Minneapolis... good.
I am husband?
No.
In your pocket, please...
Satisfied? Now get out. Out.
I...
I want to try it.
What's the matter?
What?
I will see it next time.
Why are you going here? What is here?
Sun...
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
Say it.
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.'
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
The captain...
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
I like this music.
Are you angry at me?
This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
I don't want you to be hurt.
We're not going to get a ride tonight.
No one's traveling in this weather.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
You are cold.
Oh, you're pretty...
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
May I have twenty-five cents, please?
The yellow one.
Well...
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
Help me!!!
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
You sure this is your car?
Slow down, slow down.
I know. She bought him a ticket for Lathrop Wells and put him on the bus. He didn't stay on though and they drove off together.
This has always been my favorite time of day.
There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.
Okay, let's get you wired up.  I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?
Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
Jesus.
Look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little OD won't surprise anybody. It's the only way we can be together.  You know it's true.
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
Hi, baby.  I've missed you.
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
He has his uses too.
Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing.  You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it.  And you will.
Who did it?
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
Clips.
Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?
But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
Looks like she was holding out.
He's got her up in the room, under guard.  And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work a trade.
Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?
You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
About what?
Charm.
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?
Jesus, Lenny.
What is it?
Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.
She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.
And what about the guy that was following me?
What is it?
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
Tell me.
I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
Got your ticket?
Right.  That explains it.
Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
Besides that.
Welcome back, sir. How was the vacation?
Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?
You run the plates?
Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
Hey, Sheriff.
Dylan here.
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
You... surprised me.
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
My God.
What did he look like?
How did you know he was a construction worker?
He was sitting here?
I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
You refused to comply with a direct order.
Agent Mackelway, you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms.
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
Dick Low's a killer too.
Don't you touch him.
None taken.
Don't even go there. What's up?
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
I've been thinking about this.
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.
And nobody else can do that?
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
I met with Richard Low.  These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case, but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on.
You were right. He found me.
I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
You're putting me in a difficult position.
You okay?
All the same killer?
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
I haven't changed anything.  Damn.
Bitch! Cunt! Please, please, please don't do this, Agent Kulok. You need me.
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
So you went underground?
[Fantasy time, girls, give it up, give it up.]
[Reality very risky.]
[Lionheart, what happened?]
[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
I've been to Chicago.
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
I believe it's in my file, sir.
This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.
Agent Mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
Speck is dead.
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
You want to "profile" me? Find out what makes me "tick"? Write about me, go on a talk show, give me a nickname?
Michael, this is Grandma. I want to know if you got the part on that television program. I told the whole family and they're very excited to know if...  Skipping message. End of final message.
You've been through worse.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
You should call your Grandmother.
Don't do it, Mike.
Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
How are you ladies doing this evening?
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas...
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
Hi.
Like the quiche?
Well, I left someone very special behind.
Like what?
Anything?
They're out of Glenlivet.
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me...
It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four.
Oh my God.
He's so sweet. He really said that?
What do you guys do?
You have to lay it on the table.
I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
It's not going to well?
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
Well, I should be getting...
Good.  I think about things.
So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
I mean, I need the money.
It's definitely a step back for me.
Why?
I don't talk about her that much.
I didn't mention her once today.
You want to hit the town tonight?
I'll get a Dewars rocks... 
Darwinism at its best.
No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
Uuuuugh!
I think I'm gonna move Back East.
Then why won't she call...?
How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
How's it going for you two?
You live in such a fantasy world...
I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Are you ready to order?
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit.
Vegas, baby!
Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift.
Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
That's where we make our scene.
Double down.
Always, baby.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
That's bullshit.
I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
Baby, you did fine.
I gotta use the phone.
Yeah, a good friend.
I just need some time...
Selling scrap metal.
I hear she's getting real fat.
How long do I wait to call?
So, two days?
What the fuck..?
You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
Bitch... You little bitch!
What a surprise...
Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
...Anaheim...
It's on.
Sorry man.
I'm telling you. Wait three days...
...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.
What do you wish me to do?
What was that?
You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.
You heard about your father?
We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.
You think we'll go for that last place?
No.
You take care of your family?
You look terrible.  I want you to eat well, to rest.  And spend time with your family.  And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.
No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
No, I wanted other things for you.
You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice.
Your wife and children...you're happy with them?
Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy.  And you see, Godfather...  He...my daughter...they...
You tell us about America.
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
Hey America!  Is she as rich as they say?
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
That's easy to say; it's not your father.
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
The other families won't sit still for all out war.
Jesus, I don't know...
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
What was that?
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
Hello Kay.  Your father's inside, doing some business.  He's been asking for you.
Sure.  Anything I can do for you.
Mike, why am I out?
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
You really want to know?
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
Then the legs at the knees...
Then Luca turned to the other man...
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
Michael, what are you doing?
Michael...
I don't think so either.  I better go.
We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets.
Why are you so cold to her and Carlo?  They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.
Tell me!
Absolutely not!  We have to get permission from the Doctor.
Where are you going?
Do you renounce Satan.
Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it.  Pretty soon there won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.
Buy me out?...
The Corleone family wants to buy me out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy me out.
You straightened my brother out?
Is he alive?
Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
I'll come down.
Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.
It'll just be for a little while. He can be... he makes me laugh.
Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose --
Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
I met him in New York.
I'm never going back!
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother.
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
I could fuck this icebox I love it so much.  What were you actually doing in New York?
What does he say?
Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.
Shoes too?
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way...
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
I wanted to tell you my plan.
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
What?
The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --
Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
Do you think you can steer this thing?
Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.
Hardly.
I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.
Okay.
I never said that!
Which is ridiculous. Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.
Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life.
Hello Marge.
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
That's a terrific idea.
Did Dickie's Dad go?
Tom?
You've got Dickie's rings.
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
This is spectacular.
Which is?
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight...
Dickie, my God!
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
Will we see you later?
In Rome, about three weeks ago.  I knew that one.
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
Are you okay?
Was that Meredith?
And don't forget. I have the key.
Can we go up? Do you mind?
Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago.
No!
That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge Sherwood.
Thank you.
It is a little coarse, yes.
You in Nam? Can't help but notice your jacket?
You like ball games?
Really?
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
What hours do you work?
You must be rich.
You know what you remind me of?
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
But this is a porno movie.
Damn.
No, no, please. This fare's on me. Please.
Travis?
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.
What taxi driver?
How long has he been there?
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
That's fine.
First she did her make-up. You know, I hate it when they do that. I mean she does the whole works, the mascara, the eye-shadow, the lipstick, the rouge...
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,
Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind -- and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose!
Yeah. We went to Harvard together. 
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
Stick up?
20 bucks?
What's your name?
What's your real name?
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out...
Where?
What's so important?
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
Nice talking to you, Travis.
There's porno theatres for that.
Clean. Real clean.  As clean as my conscience.
Also clean.
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
Here, officer, take me in. I'm clean. I didn't do it. Got a ticket once in Jersey. That's all. Honest, officer.
I'm here to see Iris.
Get it.
Travis.
So howsit?
Yeah.
Like do anything, you know.
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
Not really.
He's got a gun, sir.
I.don't get it.  You're going to help me?
I'll go.
What, vou?
Surprise, surprise.
Partners?
St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.  Front pew.  Right leg. = Hollow.
What about you, Delly?
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
Did you bring along something to read?
Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you.  You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning.
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
Do you have the...
We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
Well, there's got to be a way...
I see...
Delly, shhhhhh...
Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around.  I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him.  That's all.
Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?
All right, Mr. Appleton.  That was what you knew then.  What do you know now?
Yes.
So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
And... what's my name again?
You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead.
Didn't you have any help?
They couldn't wait to see you.
Ernie.
Carl.  Friend of yours from high school.  Everybody calls him "Cueball."
Ha!
Pete... go home.  Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
Nope.  Can't.  We're through.
You kids off to the dance?
It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down.
You smell gas?
Jesus.
You think he's drunk somewhere?
Take a hike.  Am-scray.
Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
That was quite a show you gave them today.  We shoulda sold tickets.
Why not?
I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
Luke!  Luke, something's wrong! The film broke, and I can't raise Harry on the house phone!
Found me.
T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army.  They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital.  I forget things sometimes.  Since the w-w-war.
That you got let go.
You mean, he was... let go, too?
Will you help me, Sandy?
Ancestors?
You hungry, son?
Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way.  Sir, are you a communist?
Miss Hayworth?
I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.
Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
No, thank you.  Won't you call me Melanie?
Thank you.
How do you like our little hamlet?
I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
I did.
He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.  I said I would.
Yes.
He got a call from Dan Fawcett a little while ago. His chickens won't eat, either.
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
Mom, they're in a cage!
They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.
Is smoking fun?
Could I have a puff?
Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
Mitch, let's turn back.
No, it's Lois!
It's a surprise, you see.
Young woman cut herself.
A what?
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
Lovebirds, I see.
And certainly pretty.
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
Maybe we ought to leave.
Mother! I'm trying my best!  I'm... trying... my...
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?
Do you think Cathy's all right?
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
I miss him.  You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, I remember.  I miss talking to him.  Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch...  ...Mitch has his own life.  I'm glad he stayed here today. I feel safer with him here. 
These birds were...
Is that for Mitch Brenner?
He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....
Oh.
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
Some of them are.
What did you say?
But how... how do you know my name?
What's that?
So you're a lawyer.
What kind of law?
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
After all, you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds.
Yes, but...
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
What did it say?
I'd still like to see you.
What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?
Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
Really? Tell me about it.
Of birds?
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
Melanie, Melanie...
I think it's safe to get out now.
I keep thinking of Annie. 
Do you want to try your father again? 
Have we still got power?
The power.
We'd better light some of those lamps.
Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels.  You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity?
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
Birds?
Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
I haven't finished my drink.
Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls.
-- pain -- and shock.  She's brave enough, but I don't know about myself.  Now that it seems so close, I wonder if I dare trust my child into any but God's hands. Maybe He knows best.
Even so, I could never think of going on -- I've got to find some other profession.
You must leave this house.
I'm cold as ice.
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
He's not home.
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
But, Doctor, I only wanted to speak to you --
Dr. MacFarlane --
Yes, I suppose so.
Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
We can't be sure of that.
I just saw Gray.  What was he laughing at?
I suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.
What do you mean, Fettes?
What's that you say?
I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him --
See that, Fettes?
Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
Hear him?
Of course -- I don't have friends. That's because I can't walk.  I try to make myself used to it.
Don't you want to find the white horse, Georgina?  You can't find him from a wheelchair.  You have to walk and run to find him.
I'm by way of being a medical myself.
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy.  Not at all friendly.
I brought you something tonight, MacFarlane -- an interesting specimen -- in very good condition.
This is a gift you'll not return.
Gray, I must rid myself of you -- you've become a cancer -- a malignant, evil cancer -- rotting my mind.
You say you've come here on your own account?  No one knows you are here?
Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
I was hoping you'd find out.
Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't matter. I want the King.
That was a fucking hollow point!
Sssshhh. She's resting.
What did they give you?
You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man!
Not my arm! What you fucking want?
The scar. Which of you has it?
I was a friend of your sister's.
Daisy. How did you know?
This is where it happened. Right over here.
This tree. Here's where it happened.
I thought we had an understanding. I thought we understood that discretion is paramount.
You know.
How about sign of a big black bird?
But you, you've had them.
Why are there so many?
What were you yelling about?
Are you ok?
What? What is it?
It still doesn't mean...
Stay away from me! Stay away!
I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?
Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
I thought that was only for bombs.
You think they'll ever find him?
No foolin'? Will you?
Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
All you have to remember is, first find the common denominator -- then subtract.
My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President  I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu.
The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel--
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
You know about the United Nations?
I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--
Good afternoon.  I'm glad to see you up and around.
Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
Well, we could--
You know how I feel, Tom. I just want to think it over.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
I wonder if we ought to--
I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.
I don't know how to thank you.
Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight.
I want to know what he told you last night.
We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with.
How dare you write on that blackboard!  Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?
Is it worth anything?
All day.
They wouldn't be out in the daytime.
All together?
They're looking at us.
Good.
Where's Star, David?!
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
I have something to tell you guys.  Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's <u>dating</u> one!
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
Oh, no...
We don't have one yet.  And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.
... And stay outta here.
Good!
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
I had the dream again about <u>them</u>.
It was a dream, Star.
He looks dead.
Michael, are you still in bed?
Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.
There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael.  Things are going to change around here when school starts.
Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!
Tell them to get something to eat.
Lights out, Sam.
What's wrong?  Tell me.
Sam!  What happened!?  You had me scared to death.  Are you all right?
Nanook, stop breathin' on me.
Oh, no.  Now what?
Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
So, I've met the one woman on the planet who's going to hold my success against me.
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
I'm Michael.
I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you.
Now you and David...
This room is mine.
You're beautiful.
Go away.
What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.
Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
Michael?
What happened, Michael!?
What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
All right... Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol.
Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?
What the hell you looking at me like that for?
Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
Whatever that Norwegian dog was... It... It was capable of changing its form...  ... when it attacked our dog... it somehow was able to digest... or... absorb it... and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog's cells exactly...  ... This for instance isn't dog at all -- it's imitation... We got to it before it had time to finish or...
What you doin'?
... Can't you see...?  If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it!  Nothing!
What?
What?
Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.
Let's open it.  Now...
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl...
I don't know how.  Because he's different than we are.  Because he's a space guy.  What do you want from me, anyway.  Go ask Blair.
Torch them!!
What do we do about those three?
... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
What are you doing?
We should have jumped his ass.
Maybe we shouldn't.
After all this mess then.
Hey, man...!
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station.
Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...
Pure nonsense.  This won't prove a damn thing.
Looks good.
Four!
How's that Thing get to the dogs?  I though we stopped it in time.
What kind of test?
Get your gear on.
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
It must have been hard, leaving your work.
... Thousands and thousands of people.  And sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories.
How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?
I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.
Send him away.
My God... I saw this.
Yes...
So, do we go on?
Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
They raise them like cattle... Feed them until they're ready and then hunt them.
I'm babbling.  Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go.  Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long.
What's your name?
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
No, we created the Morlocks.
We make them see what we wish.
And what of the Eloi?
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
Why would you let me go back?
Say I just come back again?
You took her because she helped me.
If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...
I could have a hundred Morlocks here in thirty seconds.
God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell!  How did you know to do that?
Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.
May I help you?
The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations, increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies.  Can I tell you more?
Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
You're late.
Alex, what is it?
Alex...?!
We took a walk three days ago.
Now I know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.
... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
In the future, we'll be better.
Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --
You wouldn't believe me.
Good night, David.
And this would be my study.  There was an elm tree outside the window then.
This... was my home.
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
How long did you travel?
His curiosity is amazing.
We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you.  And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
Oh, that explains everything.
I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?
You seem fascinated by the stars.
This is magnificent...
Want to be a high climber now, do you?
I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
Good -- it looks fine.  We had quite a ride together...
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
It was different then.
Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
No, sir --
My father has gone to a better place.
Where do they take them?!
My fowl have polluted the yard.
If I might explain, sir --
Yes, sir.
How did you get hurt?
We'll see about that.
Sir?
Should we be...
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
And what's that?
I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.
I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...
It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about.
Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
You done with your small talk?
This is really happening, isn't it?
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
How long do we have?
If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face.
I've been ok.
You were convicted of the crime.
You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged.
Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?
I'm not gonna let that happen.
William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.
That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer, right?
Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.
You ever been to jail?
All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?
Well, where are you from?
I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...
This is a great song.
Hon?
On what?
Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know.  I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  If just one person would say...
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
We spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a Miss Louise Sawyer.  Do you know her too?
I swear to God, she wouldn't tell me one thing!  Christ!  You oughta try to find that kid that was with 'em.
It's just not working like this.  We gotta do something.  It'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is makin' us look bad.  I don't know... maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe that little creep lied.
Oh shit.
Stop.
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
Oh.  I... where's Louise?
You're kinda the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.
Louise!  Where are you?  Are you alright?  Honey...
I am funny.  I'm real funny.
I have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it. Now I know you won't be able to get it out, but I'm good for it.  I need that money.  Can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and I'll pay you back?  Please, I'm desperate.
Do you love me?
You're in Oklahoma?!
Tell me now.
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
You didn't say what it was for, did you?
Hello...
I'm the one... I never made it work. I just... It's not that I don't love you.  It's not that.  I just never thought I'd be thirty-six years old and I never thought... I don't know what I thought.  What do you want, darlin'.  What do you want me to do.
You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm hungry.
I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
We have to think this through.  We have to be smart.  Now is not the time to panic.  If we panic now, we're done for.  Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us.  We're still okay.  Now all we have to do is just figure out our next move.
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
You're not touchin' that car.
I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
Call him?
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
I know, Louise, but we're running for our lives!  Don't you think you could make an exception just this once?!  I mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!
What's wrong with you?
For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.
Ugh!!  Why do they have to do that?
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
Besides, what do we say about the robbery?  No excuse for that.  No such thing as justifiable robbery.
Louise?  Where are we?
What little dogs?
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
I always wanted to travel.  I just never got the opportunity.
What?
What?!  What about him?!
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
What do we do?  What do you want to do?!
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
I am really sorry about this.
Ready?
I don't want to see any more beef jerky.  I mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. It's drivin' me crazy.  The whole car smells like it.
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.
Louise?
Thelma, that is not an option.
No.
We can live in a hacienda.
We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.
How far are we from Mexico?
Shit!
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
Now what?
Then let's not get caught.
What?  What are you talkin' about?
I'm not apologizing for shit!
Hi!
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted? How many we talking?
Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?
Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Mary again.
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
I don't know about this, Dom.
His mother?
That's it, I'm making an oath. I'll never procrastinate about anything again. Life is too fucking short.
Wait a second, I never told you that.
Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health...  I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.
No You mean...?
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go.
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
Dom? What are you?
Bob, do you remember Mary?
Mary.
Why don't you be a gentleman and ask Rosey?
Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did.  I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better.
I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy. You can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring at their reflections.
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
By the way, what's your name?
How'd you know that?
That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.
You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...
Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...
No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
So...
Fuck!!
Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and roses... and I'm really happy. Leave a message. BEEP.
Don't play games with me, Ted.
She's blackmailing you, right?
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
Oh Christ... poor dog.
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
Mainly I work out of Boston.
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
Oh. Well I am.
I'd go with the seven.
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
So who's the lucky guy?
Good lookin'?
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
Bundt cake?
Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
Magda!
What's up, Doc?
I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?
So who you taking to the prom?
I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears.
Are you all right?
I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.  You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
You look great.
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.
We should play some time... I mean, if you can afford to lose some money.
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.
So you're a writer?
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
...and then it was all over.  We haven't spoken since.
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.
Ted...?
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted. Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a joke a minute.
Teddy, hon, are you okay?  OH HEAVENS TO PETE!
We've been hailing the Groznyy for the last hour, Mr. Secretary. The Groznyy refuses to stop.
Starshells.
This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority?
With the caveat that it is not made public in any way, shape or form.  And we must have an answer tomorrow at the latest. I cannot stress this point enough.
As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house.
I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
Goddamn Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.
We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
He gets it, but he's pissed.
I'll do it.
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
Jesus...
Adlai's too weak! We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.
All right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. Okay? You happy? So now what?
What did you think of Lippman's column this morning?
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
And the second condition?
Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
When are you going to be home?
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
I was eating that.
Let's get out of here.
I don't like what's happening.
All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
How does a man get to a place where he can say, 'throw those lives away,' so easily?
Hello?
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me.
Bob, is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first?
Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
I see.
Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow like you, doing in a joint like this? Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like.
You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man --
Leo's gotta get to burial, Brother. He's gotta make the journey.
Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --
Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.
Leo has to take the journey, Cooch.
Maisy Blue Legs place?
What'd she say?
The right man? Talk to me, Ray.
We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.
I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?
-- Well, maybe two-seventeen.
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
Why does he wanna see me?
But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you.
What's he smoke in that?
What did he say?
-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
It's not real.
Not no more.
You tell me. You tell me who went to the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin' with your case, man. I don't give a goddamn about your case.
Still after Jimmy?
You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?
This Clear Moon's house?
What about the water...
Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
What?
Do you want a coffee?
Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.
Get up out of the chair, Richard.
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
They said I'd never see FBI again, and I'm livin' with you fuckers. I don't feed ya information on the Warriors, it's back to the pen. I don't do this, back to the pen. Your word against my word. Against a con Indian's word. I really got a chance, man, right?
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
Now I know why all the girls come here. They know how horny you guys get. But this...is ridiculous.
Everybody's got to be somewhere.
I beg your pardon.
Why not?
It never came up.
I can't.
What about the plane?
That's true. What are you?
You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.
Food...and you...my F-14!
This is it, then.
The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?
Where are we?
You don't have to do this.
I want it back.
You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.
What does it mean?
And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career...hotel management or something...
One SIXTH the speed of sound!
Sir?
That's missile lock!
OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL HAVE YOUR BUTT!
Gotta go, man.
Is it you?
What do you want?
Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
What do these guys think, I made Cougar quit?
STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN!
Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
What what are you doing? We're cover!
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
No, we...got our butts kicked.
I'VE GOT TWO MORE BOGEYS COMING IN AT FOUR O'CLOCK HIGH.
OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH.
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
Who is the best.
I don't know what to tell you, Skip.
WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.
He just won't engage. He can't do it, Skipper. He can't get back on the horse.
I've seen this before.
Who's the hell is that?
You didn't help.
Considering the company you're in, that's a pretty arrogant attitude.
Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign?
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
I can take care of myself.
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
For the same reason you are.
Skipper, sorry to bother you.
It's no disgrace, kid. That spin was hell. It would wreck anyone's confidence. You could be a good pilot again someday...
VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.
They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the ramp.
Not something they tell dependents.
You think I shouldn't fly.
Where's yours?
Welcome to Mars.
Lemme ask you a question.  Ever fuck a mutant?
What happened to number five?
Need a ride?
And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
What do you want?
I'll go encode your room key.
You see, Quaid, none of my people could get close to Kuato.  The fucking mutants could always sniff us out.  So Hauser and I sat down and invented you: the perfect mole.
I didn't want it to end this way.  I wanted Hauser back.  But nooo.  You had to be Quaid.
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.
Two-headed monsters?
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
Your sexual orientation?
Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.
What do you want?
Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.  I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down.
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
Pull them out.
Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break.
On his way.
Yeah.
What, aliens?
Hey Harry...Harry!  You ever heard of Rekall?
They sell fake memories.
Harry, what the hell is this?
Where?
He's not at ground level.
Look at this shit.
Who?
Who is she?
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
You call this a paranoid delusion?!
But Doug...There's something I want you to know.  You're the best assignment I ever hand.  Really.
I suppose you're not here either.
Doug...Bob McClane.
No options.
I give up.
What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?
Hauser, you're lost your mind.
Don't be ridiculous.
By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?
What can I do?
What reactor?!
Where's this "reactor" come from?
Wait!
Or a big mother slug maybe?
You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget shooting them.  Tell me this: can you get to your truck?
Yeah, like they got a plan...
What the hell is that, anyway?
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
A beauty, isn't it?  We bought three of them for the rec room.
BACK OFF, BURT...!
Well, we can take my truck then.
We're not going over there, right?
You're really leaving, huh?
You didn't cook breakfast?
Tammy Lynn Baxter.
So?  That car wash pays good, and they're always looking.
Well, <u>you're</u> the one won't work in the car wash.  You're the one's gotta have a plan.
Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood.
We did it!  We faced temptation and we did not bend!
So long, cactus!
You're full of shit.
Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know?
It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
Slick as snot and I'm not lying.
We'll take your word for it.
Well...haven't seen a sign for hours.  Maybe it's long gone.
Well, folks, what's the plan?
You go north, I'll go south.
<u>I'm</u> making the run to the Cat.
Come on, everybody!  We gotta run for those rocks over there!
Road's in!
<u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.
Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
How's she doing?
Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
You paying attention?  This oughta hurt like hell.
What?!!  Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be <u>some</u> way!
It worked!  There they go!
I brought it... to the coroner.
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
Forensic ballistics isn't an exact science, is it?
Don't hurt him.
-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?
What, "everything"? You shot a corpse. I don't give a shit about that -- !
Haven't heard that one before, Ed.  But I guess I'll be hearing it again.
Come now. Did you see the gun?
How can you remember that?
We have a full caseload, Rog.
It's just... I leave behind friends, family, a coupla good job offers in Chicago and in three dizzying weeks I've helped acquit a coke dealer, a speed dealer --
-- an angel dust dealer --
Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
Shoulda told the one about Shu being the bastard child of Mother Theresa.
His name is Chuckie Roeder. But something's very weird.
So an upstanding member of the Aryan Warriors wouldn't paint them on. They take those teardrops seriously -- they're badges of courage, of honor. Only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them...!
A fucking wheelchair?
Goddam it... the little punk bests me again, I get thrown down and lectured at and where the hell were you?
-- What?
Well, I mean, Roeder's gone, now... A dead end. Believe me, I'm sorry too, but...
-- What?
You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?
Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
I embellished.
Got any booze in the house?
You do.
I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.
My mother find you?
An Aryan Warrior with black teardrops painted on his face.
Afraid of what?
-- How could I help you?
Edward T. Dowd.
Of course you know Dean Rabin, one of my Assistant D.A.s. Dean generally handles nuisance cases like the... what's the man's name?
Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here?
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
We reconvict, your man's looking at 25 years on two counts, served consecutively. So what I'd like to ask, Ed, is: Are you joking?
You're pissing me off again, Ed.
Yes, Mr. Dowd.
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
Mr. Ortega, you've known the defendant at Ossining Correctional for how long?
If a member of the Aryan Brothers tries to cut in on your distribution?
You're a l-lawyer?  I... I haven't had my meds, or m-my vital signs t-taken yet. I...
That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.
No.
I'm nearly out.
The stuff we got last night.
No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
A basic kill. Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. My boys have been all over this. It's a dead end.
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer  ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer...  After that I never saw him again.
Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
Can you tell me what their names were?
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. Teresa rented it about a month ago.
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
Did you know Teresa Banks?
GOT A MAP OF THE ENVIRONS OF THE YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. BETTER BRING A POLE.
GOOD LUCK, CHET.  SAM, YOU STICK WITH CHET, HE'S GOT HIS OWN M.O. MODUS OPERANDI.  YOU CAN REACH ME AT THE PHILADELPHIA OFFICES. I AM FLYING OUT TODAY.
Phillip?
HE'S GONE.
And no one found the ring?
Take a good look around. There's nobody in this place -- you're meetin' the reason why. What'll it be?
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
You know, I never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, Teresa's arm went completely dead.
Lil was wearing a sour face.
Oh, the uncle is missing.
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
Maybe, later we could take a look.
I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
Do you want to talk?
You want a muffin?
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
Hey, Pete. Can't believe your tank's dry up at the mill.
You know what that Big "E" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm.
You got it.
The pages are gone. That's real.
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
I hate him, I hate it. Sometimes I love it. But now I'm afraid. I am so afraid.
What about James? Can't James help you? You two are so in love.
Laura, you didn't come and see me today.
Right on time, baby.
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
I've got to see you.
What about tonight?
Shit, maybe he'll kill you.
No.
Josie, I think we should go public.
I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel. It's the custom thing I was thinking of. In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.
Hi, honey, how's Donna?
Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?
Dad?
Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where's my axe?  "I'm hungry".
Leland...
Bobby didn't give you this?
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
What's wrong?
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
You're right. There's no one here.
Good.  You ever been inside a hospital?
He was accused of jury tampering.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin...  ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture...
We thought it was just.
What is the truth?
...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today.  Isn't that right?  Isn't that right...?
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
Orthopedics?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
...of Anesthesiology?
Objection, we've...
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Thank you. When Debby...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
I didn't do too well for you.
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
Do you know who her doctors were?
Thank you.
Mrs. Simmonds.
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Do we have time this morning to...  All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Sustained. Yes. The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out... They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case. Now this is it today.
What Hotel are you staying at?
I'm a lawyer.
Maybe I can do something right.
Why don't you get some rest?
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
Not if you don't grow up...
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
Thank you.
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
I can't guarantee that...
Hello, I'm calling from...
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what?
You know what happened.
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
Who are you protecting, then?
Then why don't you testify?
...You saw her?
What does it mean?  I... I mean we, you have other tactics...
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
Another, Frank...?
...now who is that...?
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
Who have we got?
John: gimme a cuesta-ray.
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness?
That's right.
...yeah... good...
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
...of the procedures...
Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
Yeah.  No sense stayin' out here.
We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
There's nobody left around here now.
Did you see it come down?
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
Did it do you any good?
Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.
I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
They've all stopped at the same time.
How does it happen cars are running?
Good to see you, General.  This is Pastor Collins, director of Civil Defense.  Sheriff Bogany, head of the local forces ... Miss Van Buren.
We can't go into town - everybody's getting out of there!  I'll fly you over to Pasadena.
Is that... machine...?
A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something.
I've been as close to them as anyone. But not close enough for real observation...
Nothing there now.
They've blocked it!
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
What is that gizmo?!
This Martian blood...  Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!
Gratzman! -- Gratzman!  Did you get those biotics?
That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.
There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!
General Mann -- I was told to expect you, sir.  I'm Colonel Heffner.
That's their position?  You've certainly got them surrounded.  I suppose they've neutralized all communications here.
They don't do much of anything...!
Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
What'll we say to 'em?
Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
Heather?
What's up?
Like Freddy.
Chase.  Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?
DO you mind...
Dylan, I gotta go.  Forgive me?
Who?
I can't sleep there, Mommy.  Please!
Hurry back, please.  I'm sleepy.
In what, a romantic comedy?
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
Freddy, for all I know.
Really?
John Saxon.  Do you have any idea what time it is?
You're right.  That sounds crazy!
Holy...
Studio B.
I'm sorry, I can't.
No, Rex is not going to die.  Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
I can tell you what the nightmares are about.  They're about this...entity. Whatever you want to call it.  It's old, very old, and it's taken different forms in different times.  The only thing that stays the same about it is what it lives for.
Like the Genie in the bottle.
If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?
Dylan.  And...  Chase.  My God, Wes, did you know?
Can I get you something to drink?
Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
I'd have liked to have said goodbye.
What?
Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
Because we believed we could make an impact out here.  Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.
Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world.
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
Raise the inner jib!  Raise the forestaysail!
Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill?
Well, that's all part of it.
How old are you, son?
There's still a way.
Why don't you go and try some of that on?
Fine.
When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you?
She isn't that old.
Yeah, that's right.  You wanna come in and shake it for me?
I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William".
Can we talk?
Everybody's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father.  Because of you.
Sorry to here it.
Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.
What'd you do?
My parents don't do it anymore.
That's how he died you know.
What are they doing?
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
You all right?
Well, spit it out.
But you invited is aboard.
I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my son, Philip.
I'll be frank with you.  This was his mother's idea.  A romp through the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me.
We'll do our best.  You're welcome to say goodbye.
What's wrong, you don't like steak?
Oh, really?
Who is it Philip?
I think you were too hard on Weathers.
What?!  What's happening?!!
And being sixteen.
What's that?
Hell, they even kicked me outa vo- tech 'cause I couldn't read a slide rule.
I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.
Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.
Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.
The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.
You gotta be kidding?  He's a human chum line!
Phil.  What are you doing?
No way Phil.  Not like this.
Do you have something to say?
Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks.
Swing up, son.
What's it going to be?
You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
Are you hating this?!  Are you!
No.
For killing a dolphin.
If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?
Come in, Montgomery, Alabama.
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
He's so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type.
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?
I'm from all over.
How 'bout a beer?
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well.
No.
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
I don't particularly care for that kind of talk, Bobby.
What's she doin' here?
Why should it?
That's right... Could have a bad accident, though... before... durin'... or after a hold-up...
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
No big buildings like in New Orleans.
So, it's back to the islands.
He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing.
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
But I'm wild at heart.
Are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl? Or are you gonna save yourself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her?
Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland?
Gotta admit, you guys are -  two in four dozen.
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
No, Marietta, I haven't found 'em.
Did she tell you where she was callin' from?
What?
I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
Did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone?
What brand'd she smoke?
You have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan.
Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin' in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby... That government of ours should be keepin' us separated from outer space...
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
I'm sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.
Sailor?
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
...I hope you appreciate my spendin' six hundred dollars, not countin' what it cost us to get here and back... This man's the best damn abortionist in the South.
One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
Her face was half-pushed into the pillow, and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, 'I won't suck you. Don't ask me to suck you.'
I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
What's that, honey?
It's huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time.
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?
Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.
More'n likely.
I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are.
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
You upset with me?
We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.
Sailor, what are we gonna do?
Sailor?
It's okay by me, peanut.
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
You must be my son.
You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet.
The reptiles were supposed to be of a docile species, said a senior government official, but it seems the breeders bungled and reared attack crocodiles.
In the Ganges near Varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin' corpses dumped by Hindus too poor to pay for cremation.
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
Mama, I'm hangin' up this phone now.
I'm afraid his car is gone, Mrs. Fortune.
Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.
You need to explain it.
Shoot him? Like with a gun?
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
You got nice tits.
Santos... Where's J-J-Johnnie?
Hey, Sailor boy, you wanna fuck Lula's mama?...
No... I just wanted to kiss you good- bye... You know too much 'bout little Lula's mom...
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
You really are one dumb asshole.
I ain't heard of nothin'.
What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
You're stoned.
It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it.
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
He is. Take my word for it.
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
Not Curtis.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
Yes.
What's this guy's problem?
Shit.
James? My James? What's happened?
How bad is it for you?
So modest.
Shut up, James.
So whose car is it?
Such as.
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
I passed out.
I know.
She told you about...
Who's got a gun?
It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore.
Goodbye, Grady.
Go ahead.
Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, too.
Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.
Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle.  Have one.
Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.
He didn't give his name.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
Professor Tripp?
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
It's not so bad. I know the night janitor. And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.
Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley Heights. We could find you a nice golf course to barf on.
I've got a thing about, places like this. I know what those houses are like. I know what the people are like.
It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
Colon cancer.
Carvel.
The one that left you?
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
You're lying.
But, last night...
I'm sorry.
Let me spell it out for you, James. Books don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not anymore.
Want a bite?
When?
Near Carvel?
Can I -- I mean -- do you mind -- if I wear this again. Professor Tripp?
Does she mean -- does she know about... her dog?
I'm a little worried, James.
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck.
He cribbed that from Borges.
I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.
New?
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
Has he asked to see the book yet?
You had another one, didn't you? You have to see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday morning. All right?
Who's gun is that?
Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, too.
You heard? How?
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.
This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, Grady.
And what did you say?
I went and looked at some babies just now.
I guess you have to go on faith.
Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
He's writing his name in water.
Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.
You mean because his career's ruined and all?
That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap.
Walter?
Excuse me?
What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?
Maybe I should read it.
No, the dog.
Are you riding with me, James?
I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.
Hey, is that a school?
Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus.
I was just thinking of... the noise.
Law says I can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. I figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet?
What are you doing?
Cherry.
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
Then what? What?!
I've got some pictures.  Want to see?
Anna will be away at camp. The house will be quiet. It's better when it's quiet.
Nothing.
Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?
What does that mean?
What's up?
I haven't broken any laws.
I would.
Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun.
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
You knew her?
That's a nasty scratch on your neck.
The passionate one?
So. How are you adjusting?
And your new apartment?
Have you seen Walter?
Yeah, like the bird.
No.
A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.
You said you couldn't make the sound of a solitary vireo. But you did. Beautifully. I heard you.
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
No.
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.
Try it.
How's the journal?
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
You have no feelings for your niece?
Do you think you're crazy?
How long is this going to take?
Will I ever be normal?
You don't know!
Walter, we'll pick up here next time.
I'd like you to close your eyes.
To relax.
Where is she? What is she doing? How old --
Where?
I don't like nobody behind my back!
There's something wrong with this picture.
I'm talking about you.
Is that a school?
They could eat you.
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
I'm not easily shocked.
So, you're not a dyke.
No you're not.
You're not joking.
Sorry.
I never hurt them. Never.
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
Being here, with me.
Most people say the odds are against me.
We should live together.
I've got problems.
I say we call it quits.
I don't need a plant.
Don't do that.
I didn't sleep well.
Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?
You got it?!  You got it?
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.  Do you read, over?  This is Deepcore--
Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call from topside.  That new company man.
What's goin' on, Boss?
Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just breathe easy.
I can't believe you let them do this!
I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
You wanna know what I think?
I haven't worn mine in months.
What happened?
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
But what did he see that made him panic?
Need some help?
The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
Jesus, Lindsey--
It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling.
Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.
You owe me one, Virgil.
You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.
You totaled it, huh?
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
You see where it's coming in?
Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?
Son of a bitch!
I don't know how!
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.
Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.
Do we just leave him there?
Come on, man.  What else could it be?
Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It ain't.  I'm sorry...
Y'all could be more specific.
Those guys ain't so tough.  I fought plenty of guys tougher'n them.
Hippy, you pussy.
Quiet!  Quiet!
Cab One, do you see it yet?
I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.
Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.
1840... 50... 60... 70...
Figured that out for yourself, did you?
No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
Hey!
What kind of light?
Would we see the flash?
How are you?
Anna... Maybe it would be better to wait a while.
Sandro... A month is too long a time. I have become used to being without you.
But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
But where are you going?
You know, I could just as well go without seeing him today.
Used to what?
And have you any other truths to tell me?
It's already two hours... What are we going to do?
But how could we...at a time like this when we just... well, let's at least first have a look around the other islands. Could be that something might turn up there.
Well?
Have you decided?
Shall we go for a swim?
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive... Why, even this morning... that business about the shark... it wasn't at all true.
And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for her -- mine, yours, even her father's, in a certain sense -- weren't enough for her, or didn't mean much to her.
Any news?
Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas...
Good night, my love.
He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia?
But where did you finally end up?
Do you consider that a compliment?
Who are you talking to?
But Corrado...  If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
And what are we going to do now?
They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?
Yes, sir. Three times.
What other boat?
And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
Certainly a radio this small is very practical. It's especially useful for... I don't know... for traveling.
Anything new develop?
Whose boat is that?
Patrizia, what are you going to do?
We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.
She costs a hundred thousand lire.
She'd punish me.
Look at the statues, they're thin.
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility.
What do you mean?
Should you see a doctor?
Let's talk about something else.
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
He's told you?
Often?
I don't know.
I went to my room.
From God.
I... I don't understand.
Do you have any children?
Would you like some?
Why not?
Why do you smoke?
What else did she tell you?
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
Agnes...
Did your mother see angels often?
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
Why not?
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
What the child?
But you're troubled... aren't you?
Sometimes, yes.
She can't hurt you any more.
Yes?
And that you're stupid?
What?
You're listening to a chorus of angels. The music surrounds you like a... warm and, comfortable pool of water. And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me.
Of telling you.
Would you like to tell me?
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
Which one?
Of what?
Who?
Alright Agnes... it's alright. One, two three...  It's alright... it's me, Doctor Livingston, it's alright, alright. Thankyou Agnes, thankyou. How do you feel?
Do you remember what just happened?
Stay away from me...
Martha, you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law.
All I want is one more week.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
I'll have it.
Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...
You were a smoker?
And you didn't try to find out who?
Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
I've already told you what I thought.
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
Nuns... you hate nuns.
Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
It's my affair too.
I'm only interested...
I am...
Sister Paul?
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
Listening to angels?
She molested her!
There is more here than meets the eye isn't there?  Lots of dirty little secrets.
And my permission?
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear.  Does my smoking bother you?
Mary Magdelen?
Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?
May I be present?
If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you. 
Don't be ridiculous.
You wanted that child out of the way.
Before or after you killed the child?
She can't remember.
Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.
I'm a deserter.
All right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.
Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
Are you going in?
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
Gerron.
What's up?
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
You haven't, you're just late.  Oh, yes, he's going to be very pleased with you.
Oh, Paul, you can't have your own way!!!
How'd you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo?
What are we waiting for?
Are you supposed to be here?
Gear?
They ought to be.
I bet you don't sound like real people.
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
Ah.
Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
So you <U>are</U> a man after all.
And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?
What are you doing?
Come on let's get this coffee.
That'll keep you busy.
What are you doing there?
Eh ... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?
How d'you reckon that one out?
I hope he fell off.
We've broken out, oh, the blessed freedom of it all!  Eh, have you got a nail file, these handcuffs are killing me. I was framed. I was innocent.
You won't interfere with the basic rugged concept of my personality, will you, girl?
What's old got to do with it?
Y'what?
Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.
Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.
Hi Norm!
Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
You are.
And my nose...
He's betrayed the class.
Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
Yeah, you want to watch it.
He's been gone a long time.
How's that?
"The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr. Richard Starkey, that's you, in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet." Blimey!
What's the matter with you? You were bashing away like a madman.
Eh, what's all this?
Oh... God... am I cold...
Engines off.
There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
Do you remember the pyramid?
Where's Irth?
Gravity?
Dell, I want greater magnification. More surface detail.  I want to see what this place looks like.
I'm sending.  Do you hear me?
This is Chaz.
I was scanning the horizon to see what I could pick up.  Look there, on that screen.
Maybe we can get in by the top.
Are you okay in there?
Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about?
Unknown!  What do you mean?
Well, get started.
You like this shit?
Okay.
Where does that go?
What happened?  Where's Sandy?
Dead!
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
Blood's thoroughly oxygenated.
That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
I'll do it.  The rest of you continue.
Listen, it sure didn't like this flamethrower.
You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.
Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.
What?  What was that?
What do you mean, no?
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.
Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?
I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.
If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
Doesn't seem much doubt about it, does there?
It won't come -- it's stuck.
We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
Too primitive.  It's a pre- technological construction.  That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best.
We'll have to catch it and eject it from the ship.
How?
That's the one about the albatross, right?
We came out there, we'll go back.  A long time by the clock, but a short time to us.
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
Where are we?
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Okay, Chaz, I hear you.  I've got you on my board.
Still worried?
Look at these suckers -- no wonder we couldn't get it off him.
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
I think the best thing to do with Broussard is to just freeze him as he is.  It'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the Colonies.
Now what?
This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing.
That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker.
Which presumably means...
It was time for that a couple days ago.
<u>Hey watch it</u>!
Yeah, it's fine.
A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.
What do you need?
Are you alright?
I found it...
When?
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.
Still got him?
Wait.  Lost it.
Miss Noguchi!  You're wanted in admin.
What happened?
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?
That's what we thought.
Four.
What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  That should give us ample time to find it.
So, what do you think?
Hurry it up.
I expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet...
Of course your performance was no surprise to me. After the other day I regarded it as no more than - a promised fulfilled.
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
I'm about to go into the shower, I won't be able to hear you...
Hungry?
Aren't you?
You know me better than that.
What time?
Addison, won't it be just perfect? Lloyd and I - there's no telling how far we can go... he'll write great plays for me, I'll make them be great!  You're the only one I've told, the only one that knows except Lloyd and me...
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
That's not true!
You used my name and my column to blackmail Karen into getting you the part of "Cora" - and you lied to me about it!
Then say so.
I won't play tonight.  I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on...
That isn't a waiter, my dear. That's a butler.
Claudia dear, come closer.  This is Max Fabian. He is a producer. Go do yourself some good.
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool. By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children-
I'm giving her a very high-class party. It ain't like a rehearsal, she don't have to be late.
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-
Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.
Margo, as you know, i have lived in the Theater as a Trappist monk lives in his faith. I have no other world, no other life - and once in a great while I experience that moment of Revelation for which all true believers wait and pray. You were one. Jeanne Eagels another... Paula Wessely... Hayes - there are others, three or four. Eve Harrington will be among them...
Macbeth.
Take care of yourself out there...
Then you're crazy.
I leave in a week - the picture's all wrapped up, we previewed last night... those previews. Like opening out of town, but terrifying. There's nothing you can do, you're trapped, you're in a tin can-
Happy birthday, darling...
Okay.
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...
The kid - junior, that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...
It's all over.
The kid. Junior.
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
Paranoiac!
Well, I am.
Don't be condescending.
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
It's not nonsense.
But you may quote me as follows. Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play, the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. Unquote.
Often enough to keep the franchise.
Hello, what's your name?
I don't have to. I want to.
Every day.
What have I got to do with it?
Don't run away, Bill.
You think?
Find out.
Lemme fix you a drink.
It was Fort Sumter they fired on-
I'm sure you must have things to do in the bathroom, Birdie dear.
You bought the new girdles a size smaller. I can feel it.
If I may so bold as to say something - did you ever hear the word "union"?
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
That's all.
You probably won't believe me.
How'd you get all the way up here from Brooklyn?
Not at all.
You see the play? You've seen the play every performance?  But, don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?
I'm going to take you to Margo...
Hello, Miss Channing.
Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me-
Don't worry too much about that. Margo just doesn't miss performances. If she can walk, crawl or roll - she plays.
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
I've got a lot to say. And none of it is easy.
Oh, but there is-
Eve... don't cry.
He can help you.
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
She knows enough not to be here.
I guess it started back home. Wisconsin, that is. There was just mum, and dad - and me. I was the only child, and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that I couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?
I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?
I've got it.
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother.
Terribly sorry I'm late, lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab - where's Miss Caswell, shall we start? Oh, hello, Eve...
Miss Channing, I can't tell you how glad I am that you arrived so late.
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...
Ain't it the truth?
Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...
He always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical-
Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me...
About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too.
In this rat race, everybody's guilty till they're proved innocent! One of the differences between the Theater and civilization...  ... what gets me is how all of those papers in town happened to catch that particular performance!
With tears?
- 'at's my loyal little woman.
Now let's not get into a big hassle-
That's on time for Margo.
It's just possible she didn't...
Margo hasn't done badly by it.
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
If - instead of waiting until next season to do 'Footsteps on the Ceiling', which is in pretty good shape - and if Margo can be talked into going on tour with 'Aged in Wood' - we could put 'Footsteps...' into production right away...
Well of all-
What's so funny?
Honey chili had a point. You know, I can remember plays about women - even from the South - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers...
Karen and I just don't want an accident-
It's been quite a night. I understand that your understudy - Miss Harrington - has given her notice.
Very discreet. A note right out in the open like that. Next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass...
That's right, but I don't understand-
When's the audition?
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
This is for lawyers to talk about, this concerns a run-of-the-play contract, and this you can't rewrite or ad lib!
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
July of '71.
What's that?
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
Who's first?
This is terrific work, if you like rejection.
And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars--those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down. What else do we know?
We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.
I  couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth.
He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding--might surprise him if you're not.
--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
Segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two.  Switch to another station, huh? You're driving me crazy with that.
He'll give us a sworn statement.
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
--Jesus--
Woodward?
What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
You overslept?
What does it say?
Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
Mr. Dardis does call in every so often?
Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See? 
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
I was just curious--you don't do it well, so I wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it?
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
The ones who could disburse the money.
Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office, Irwin?
--then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written--
We were never told flat out "Don't talk." But the message was clear.
--that leaves Haldeman, period.
--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--
What's this?
I don't think either Metropolitan or National should cover the story.  I don't think we should cover the story, period.
It will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time.
I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.
--what do you think?--
Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward, I'm from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case--
Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, "I'm not here," Mr. Caddy said.
She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?
The twenty-five thousand dollar one.  The one with your name on it.  In Bernard Barker's Florida account.  Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar--
Yes, sir.
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
I saw the flag signal--what's up?
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.
They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
There were more then.
And Justice and FBI know all this?
Where?
Where in government?
I'm so glad you could come, Mr.--
Are you sure?
And the underground garage one.  Would I know him?
As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly.  Except  it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters--  --and  these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying--  --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices.  Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.
...go on, go on...
OK, get on this W.House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord.
What'd you get on W.House?
So?
What do you think Mrs. Graham wants to see me for?
--which Young?
Mr. Sloan?
I can't say anything, I'm sorry. 
No, it was good.
Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
This.  Right now.
Of course, Finch.  What?
You know, Jim...you could go back there...and...
You're gonna shit your pants!
I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age.  Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.
Yeah...so like, what else <u>do</u> you do?
Hey, what're you doing here?
Um...Chris --
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
I know.  Salt and pepper?
So we're gonna be close next year?
Oz, it's okay, I know.
Hmm.  You know that's  really a shitty middle name!
What?  We both have cars.
...I've never tried it.
You got it, stud.
No comment.
Are you kidding?  No.
Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.
Don't you love my sexy body?!
Hey, minuteman.
How do you know that?
Back out?  You don't need <u>us</u> to get laid.  You afraid or something?
I know, Dad.
Dad!  I know!
Son.  This lady's here for you.
You know, at band camp?  We have dances like this.  Only they're way funner.  Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.
You guys got the Latin homework?
Who cares?
You can do that?
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
Okay...that would be cool sometime.  How 'bout tomorrow?
No, no, you must put your whole body into it.
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
Tonight?
Vicky, wait.
Oh...ungghhhhh!
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
You're not doing the extra credit problems.
Like how?
But you don't love me.
Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents.
Hey...
About the other day...I've been thinking.
And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
Now?!
You sure you're comfortable?
That was a great night.
I can't believe we just had our senior prom.
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
Say that again, Kevin?
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
Feeling better, Oz?
What reputation?
Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?
...Guess what?
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
That junior chick?
You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss?
<u>Yeah</u>!
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
Like an underground club?
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
Andy! Holy shit!
Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...
Serafine...
You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.
What the fuck!? You too!?
I hope they fucking fry us all.
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
We can't stop him. Not now. Handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. Please Andy...
What does it say?
Whoa...
Okay. Be careful.
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Encul d'Americain.
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
What's the problem?
Do you think I'm an idiot?
Nothing's happening!
Not you too -
Andy, I have to tell you about the dream I had - or that I'm still having - it feels like a systemic, physio- tropic reaction to some drug, maybe a triptamine or phenethylamine derivative. But it is hyper-real. I'd swear my legs had been cut off or... wait a second... I'm getting a strange meta-physical buzz. Shit. I'm, uh, dead, aren't I?
Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell.
He's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my English is better.  This way... So you're from New York eh? I love those Hill Street Blues...
Jesus...
Alright. Let me write a letter.
Okay. So he's weird. Maybe on drugs. Still, that's not -
Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
Andy, stop! I think he can help you - 
Merde.
Saint Severin...
"Together in Paris"! Oh, when can we be "together in Paris?!
Hurry, Grandmama!
I have to go now, before it gets light.
Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
Ouch!  That really hurt!
You never thought of the possibility?
Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
I'm going to stretch my legs
Come on up!
Forged papers! Now, what?!
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
Anya, wait!
Don't you, child?
Dmitri didn't want the money?
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
I've spent my whole life waiting to find you ...
Trust me, it's her!
Hurry up with those papers.
Wake up, young lady, that's our train.
We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich!
So. You don't want to go to the coronation, eh?
You are the boy ...
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
She does.
Rasputin!  You're alive . . .
Perhaps you could convince her?
Can I have your autograph?
Singer!
You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?
Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
We've been through this.
Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather."
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
Oh - you're an actress.
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
You want your tennis stuff?
Who? Grammy? Grammy Hall?
You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?
Jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. She-she was too busy getting raped by Cossacks.
No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure.
Oh, you see an analyst?
Sylvia Plath.
Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.
Duane?
Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know...
Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know.
I know.
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-
Hey, listen, listen.
Yeah?
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
Here, you want some?
Hey?
Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
big subject with me, yeah.
Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
Don't you think I do?
Whatta you mean? You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?
Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
Alvy, you were... Alvy, you were just great, I'm not kidding. It was- You were so neat.
Yeah.
You're so sure about it.
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
and I keep, you know, it's-
She said, "Will it change my wife." You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.
David! David! I can't believe this!
Well, I was in be- It's three o'clock in the morning. You, uh, you got me outta bed, I ran over here, I couldn't get a taxi cab. You said it was an emergency, and I didn't ge- I ran up the stairs. Hell - I was a lot more attractive when the evening began. Look, uh, tell- Whatta you- Are you going with a right-wing rock-and- roll star? Is that possible?
Darling, darling, I've been killing spiders since I was thirty, okay?
Hey, what is this? You got black soap?
Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart.
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
Okay, okay. Okay.
Yeah, but it's real close.
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
Check it out.
Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
God, it's so clean out here.
Christ!
Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
No.  Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.
You mean that...  I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you.
Oh!
Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-
Man, that's great. That's just great.
Tsch, a few.
I can think of another word.
Are you?
I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual...
What I wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure.
Wait a minute! Really? Really? I happen to teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media and Culture"! So I think that my insights into Mr. McLuhan- well, have a great deal of validity.
Yes.
Charlie Chaplin.
Sixteen years ago.
Mean?
Don't give me your life story  just pick up the license.
Just give me the license, please.
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
Max, my serve is gonna send yuh to the showers-
Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
Oh.
Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.
We do the show live in front of an audience.
What's the matter?
There are no twos, Max.
If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole.
But she's colored.
They're persecuted enough!
Look at you, you-you're such a clown.
I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
Oh.
Oh, yeah, really, oh!
Oh. What about?
Uh... w-we're going back to the Pierre. We're staying at the Pierre... and we're gonna meet Jack and Angelica, and have a drink there, and... if you'd like to come, uh, we'd love to have you.
Oh, and there's another thing about New York. See... you-you wanna see a movie, you have to stand in a long line.
Did you see permits?  Did he have a license?
So who won?
The movie.
I have a small window of time.
It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours.  You know it could be disaster.  He's so allergic.  It's terrifying.
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
Just don't fucking tell her.
You should have brought him.
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
Let's get the kids.
Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.
Just did.  Jealous?
The suspense is killing me.
Stupid tart.
And you know our friends, how?
Are you my big hard hero?
It was fifteen seconds.
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest.
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
Scout's honor.
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
Take your time, Jer.
No luck.
Kiss the back of my knees.
No.  Did you?
Don't get it.
You want me to uninvite her?
Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
Otis!  No barking!
In the kitchen.
Still champions.
Okay, knock it off.
Don't be so sure.
She left the fucking gate open.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
Otis!!!!
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!
And how hard it hit?
Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.
Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I don't understand you.  And I don't think I ever understood Lucy.  I don't understand throwing it away.  How do you throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I want the possibilities.  And all kinds of crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  All the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  We'd have had amazing children, you and me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have surprised yourself.  I'll never love anybody else, you know.
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
I know.
Coffee?
Oh.  Well.  Good.
No.
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
Well, you know...good days, bad days.
Something soft.
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
Lemon or raspberry?
Medallions.
I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
I think there are sixteen there.
How's he doing?
Well, yes, actually.
I don't need a drug.
Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog.
Hors d'oeuvres or something?
Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
Would you, like, marry him?
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
How?
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
Okay.
We're just feeling our way back.
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
Why not?
Well, something's wrong.
Yes.
I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.
He's a novelist.
So where should I put it?
Well good.  Thank God.
No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
Don't try and change the subject.  Oh God, it feels great!  He's just a little narcissistic, irresponsible and unreliable.
I don't have a drug problem.
Break's over.
Tell me about it.
Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!
Someone who follows his heart!
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run!
You're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you?
And you are...?
You dance...
-- At the <u>worker bar</u>!  You were pretty hot to trot then!
What <u>was</u> that thing?
I order you to find out where we are!
Excuse me, I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.
Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
We're going to die!
Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess...
We've found it!  <u>Insectopia</u>!  Look at all this food'
Of course not --
You new, kid?
You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule.  We have thirty-six seconds available right now.
Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Affirmative.
What's this?  A <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?!
What do you see out there?
Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging.  No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me.
You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
Wear this.
I'm getting lonely.  Who are you talking to, anyway?
This the place?
Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
Ma'am?
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
What did you do to your hair?
Oh, I never catch colds.
Good night.
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
No.
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
One more?
You all right? What's the matter?
Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays -- I could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling --  -- you sure this is the right way to wear it?
Don't you remember? We were at the office party together --
My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you are --
Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.  Just what are you going to tell her?
You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
His apartment?
What's her first name?
She doesn't seem to like you very much.
Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
Cut.
What for?
You turned it on -- but you didn't light it.
In this house, you're supposed to.
Thank you.
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
How's everything at the apartment?
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
I guess so.
Yes.  You walking to the subway?
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
Where are you going? BUD Who knows? Another neighborhood -- another town -- another job -- I'm on my own.
Last night?
Would you mind repeating the question?
No, sir. I'm not going to deny it. But if you'd just let me explain --
That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
Where are you going, Baxter?
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
Well -- I guess so.
Oh, yes. Thanks.
You're not making sense, Baxter. What's this all about?
Sir?
You left your wife?
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
Here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover. Thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get married, twenty-two percent quit because --
What's gotten into you, Baxter?
Now hold on, Baxter --
On account of me.
Mr. Sheldrake?
You're on your way up, Buddy-boy. And you're practically out of liquor.
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
A lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice.  What is she trying to prove?
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.
Look, you can't stay here. Just take your champagne and go.
That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice.  Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to call you.  I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall. You see, my little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but I'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.
I sympathize with your problem -- and believe me, I'm very sorry --
Good evening, Baxter.
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
What are you going to do, Doc?
Hello, Miss Kubelik.
Say, Baxter -- we're having a little party and we ran out of ice -- so I was wondering --
No, thanks -- I don't feel like it. Look, Doc -- in case I don't see you again -- how much do I owe you for taking care of that girl?
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
That so.
Family?
Can I ask you a personal question?
Say, what's going on here, anyway?
Here -- find yourself a phone booth and call your husband in Havana.
-- so yesterday afternoon I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's got stashed away in the bedroom?
Kubelik.
Toot? It's more like a lost weekend. Neither of them showed up for work today.
Sleeping pills.
And what happened to you?
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
It's been hell.
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
Come on, Fran -- don't be like that. You just going to sit there and keep bawling?  You won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong --  Look, I know you think I'm stalling you. But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "Pass the sugar -- and I want a divorce." It's not that easy.  Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids are home from school -- my in- laws are visiting for the holidays -- I can't bring it up now.  This isn't like you, Fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with --
Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
I know it's a drag -- but you can't find a hotel room in town -- not on New Year's Eve.
Just walked out on me -- quit -- threw that big fat job right in my face.
What are you talking about?
You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.
Stay with it, Buddy-boy!  Come on, Sylvia.
Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay --  That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
Hey, Dad -- why don't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive?
Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
Where are you headed?
Look -- we got in a little trouble -- they rudely took our helicopter for MedEvac work on this -- uh Operation Brute Force -- They just brought it back this morning.
Look -- you know who that is, Captain -- you know what she's saying -- you'll never see stuff that good outside of a magazine for the rest of your life.
What's there to talk about -- this whole thing disgusts me.
What !
You're out of your skull --
Two whole drums --
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
Moonby what?
That's good gin.
Yeah.
So what happened ?
Whatdoya think it thinks.
And the grass?
Captain -- they've been probed all this week -- Cong and NVA regulars. There's gonna be a big offense any time.
What are we doing here?
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
I don't get it -- You said your mission was to kill him. Let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. This  Kurtz is ruining the war; I mean, this don't look good for America !
Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another.
What'd he say?
The Delta closes off to us about ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll be able to pick up some supplies -- bit I think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River. It's all Charlie's turf from there on out.
Whoever put'em there didn't do it to kill people -- They put 'em up as signs --
Two hours after the fog lifted, we moved slowly to a spot we thought was roughly a mile and a half below Kurtz's camp. We approached a long sand-bank stretching down the middle of the river.
What do you want ?
You didn't like him.
What does that mean ?
Our Recon flight ?
Do me a favor buddy, please.
How did they know?
Yeah.
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.
A habit of men of war, sir -- you understand.
Captain?
But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.
Upriver? Why upriver? There is nothing there, only jungle.
What's your name, sailor ?
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
Good swell.
Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !
Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change.
Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke Six. Join me in sparaying some trees.
Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th Recon Group -- I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence 11 Corp -- I believe you understand the nature of my mission.
Can you trust them?
Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter Kurtz commanded a Green Beret detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?
I said get the fuck out !  I'm going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow.  He's only stayed alive this long because he's a good orderly and medic. He knows how to use a hypodermic.
No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water.
How's yours?
I think think a lie stinks.
Were you with him, when...
No -- no, Captain.
This one , Lance?
Captain Willard?
Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.'
You must realize, Captain -- we have lost much here -- I, my husband. Gaston -- his wife and son.
Cognac?
What will you do after the war?
What's a big question?
Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages?
Are you warm, Captain?
So that's it.
What if I say no.
Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ?
Well , who's in command here?
You came right to it, son of a bitch --
What?
30   CONTINUED:
102  CONTINUED:
You talk about ecology -- there it is.

How long have you been up north?
Where'd you say Eric is?
What about that hotheaded marshal, Sam Wilder?  I heard he was in the middle of this mess.
Winter.  Two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed.  Which would suit me fine.
You're hurt.
Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
I'm not gonna carry you out of here.
We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.
Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
Have to backtrack, find another way down.
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
Sure love to know where you fit in up here.
There's a snowmobile. Inside a day we could be on the Yukon.  I got money there.  Remember that five thousand?  Make it ten.  Be smart.  Take it and walk away.
Stay awake!  You want to go hypothermic?
Told you I'm fine!
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
Nome?  I figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there.
Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
You were real resourceful out there.  Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.
Answer and I'll shoot!
Look down there, tell me what any of this matters.  Struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness. Soon there won't be a trace of our troubles... or us.
Relax.  One more day without drink won't kill you.  Right, Sam?
All this for laying traps on private land?
I need to rent a cabin.
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
Mr. Desmond!  Arthur Neff.  Area rep for the Federal Assistance Plan.  Tell the boys in DC to keep those goodies coming.
If Corbett's men find out --
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
This miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.  With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.
Bet you're right.  But I didn't come by to wangle a meal --
Why the smirk?
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
Go easy.
Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.
Naah, Wilder knows we got friends in town.
There's what they're waiting on!
Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
What is it you want? What?
How was it talking to him?
Hi...  Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?
What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
How long has he been having problems?
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
Doc!!!  So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll...
I'm starving.
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
I'm hungry.  You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.
You waiting for me to say something?  What sort of thing do you want? Look, I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.
So you'll be at work?
What's this?
No... no thank you notes.
Lovely.
Nice of you... thank you.
No, sir...
Melvin, I'd rather not.
I was going to do that for you.
No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?
And?
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...
That's maybe the best compliment of my life.
Well, ah... that's a personal question.
If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
I'll never forget you said it.
I don't want to hear that music right now.
Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.
How you doing?
That seems like a good choice.
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
Because...
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
Well...
Was this supposed to be your room?
But what about...
What the heck are those for?
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
No touch. No touch. No touch.
It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off.
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
What?
Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
Yes, we do... And I can give you a tie and jacket.
Terrify me?
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
Is he dead yet?
Absolutely.
Oh, is he dead?
My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like?
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.
No, I didn't.
Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?  By the way, thanks for saving me.
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.
Please, just leave.
Now we'll both call him.
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
I get why you're angry. It's no snap to explain why I was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run...
... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
I told you to go on in.
I think you gotta camp it here...
What did she say?
Because...  ... you love her?
Did you like it that much?
Picking on me won't help.
How do you write women so well?
Why are you doing this?
Bain.  Michael Bain.
Hey.  What I don't get was why didn't you take the shot inside the restaurant?  I mean you had me, a free shot.  That's what I would have done.
How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
Michael?
Such language in front of a lady.
I don't know what the fuck you are.
Who is the mark?
Hello, Robert.
A player?
What?
Um, five.
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
Bullshit.
You want me to pump?
Who is that other guy?
So this is something between you and him?
Why?
I don't need the money.
Oh Jesus Jesus...
Electra.
Had?
Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
Women?  No... not really.
Hey, where are you?
But you've never figured out a way to win.
I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
What do you think he's doing?
You should knock.
That's right.
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
Ten years ago, I sat there in that same hotel window, sweat pouring off of me waiting --
Ten years ago.
What did he say?
They're worth less points.
Did you think they were newlyweds?
I went into their room this afternoon.
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
She is married, but not to him. Another man, much older.  She has four kids.  The young guy works for her.  And I think she likes kinky sex.
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
Yes.
It happened to you before?
What happened to her?
Did you --
Is this becoming complicated?
Four minutes.
I'm taking off my mike.
Was nice.
I wasn't watching television.
You're very good at this aren't you?
Then, I'll sail alone.
How much farther?
I know this may seem like a strange question, but can I ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, I know you're a professional, but just for me, I was just wondering.
I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway?
Right.
What are you thinking about?
Why didn't you fade?
How would you like the funds?
So how's your work?
Fresh from the shrink I'd say!
What is it with that Josh guy? Who does he think he is shoving that Reflections rag down our throats?
Because it's in English?
But we are underground?
Just because they've got a choice of four McDonalds, doesn't mean they can afford a cheeseburger.
What we need is a space for real performance art. A cultural exchange for radical expressionism.
Good news comrades, it's better than we'd hoped. Lubosh filled me in on the legal side of squatting here and it's a piece of cake.
Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.
Chris, what if I were to cut you in as partner in this project - together we could make it swing, all it needs is a good clean out and the power on, then we're in business.
And put it on expenses?
I'm making history Chris, nothings going to stop me. There could be a knighthood for us in this, once President Havel hears.
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
I'm an idiot?
I've been saying that since we met.
Well, it's definitely there - We've just got to get to it.
I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
Afternoon!
No, not if you've got better things to do.
Like a hand?
We'd better get some booze in for tonight.
Here, let's both put in two hundred crowns. That should get nine or ten bottles of wine.
No, We aren't going to do it.
What happened to Katka?
Does Jahn's thing have a name?
It's me you want, I'm responsible for all this.
I don't want to ruin your day.
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
I stopped by your office. Henry was steaming, he says he's going to throw you out of the window and that you never worked at the Bugler.
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
It was all in Czech wasn't it.
Yeah, somewhere?
What do you want me to do?
What about me?
You don't understand, I can't!
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
You mean, Josh's father had nothing to do with it?
It's that one isn't it.
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
I'd like to talk with you about doing some performance poetry here....A weekly thing.
A word of advice my celibate friend. These Czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don't be fooled; there's a price to be paid and it's going up fast. Right Kat?
Doug I can't, I've got to be at work by eight. You promised to take me home.
It's not fair, you hardly talked to me tonight.
I hope you're going to invite me in?
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.
It was a mistake, I never wanted to hurt you, but it had to end sooner or later and now, well now I love someone else.
Yeah, for sure.
They'll do it.
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
Any chance of getting me out on bail?
Will this thing take long?
I'll put one on the notice-board too.
Is it dry?
It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.
I'd better get going, do you need a hand to get into bed?
Run into Josh?
Better than you.
Why don't we both forget about him?
Really!
What is it you want?
I'll need to make a phone call.
Would you like your things now?
Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
All I'm saying Honey is run the thing past me for Christ's sake before you get up and broadcast the crap.
I don't want to go.
Come on Holly!
You are responsible...What has happened?
So, who is in the building?
And what of these foreigners?
Pictures from the play. Jamie looks pretty --
After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once.
Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?
I have no idea what to say. How to act. What if I do the wrong thing?
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.
Get yourself a glass.
You don't know me.
'I hope your dreams come true.'
Fire is like a living thing. Wild. Unpredictable.
Cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world.
You have to believe to have faith.
He doesn't trust you.
The play's going to be really good.
So it's like you want to be secret friends.
You were great the other night.
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
What does that mean?!
Like fire.
Is there a rush?
It's only 7:30.
Your turn.
The cells in our bodies are always changing. In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
Stand right here.
Come on.
How do you know this place?
When did you build this?
Are you trying to seduce me?
Ergo?
What's the best thing I can see tonight?
Here. Why am I looking at this star?
One of your secrets.
Jamie --
Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie needs. I'm here.  I could start by driving her to school --
'What is a friend? A single soul dwelling in two bodies.' Aristotle.
I'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman.
Did you give him a gift?
Boys like him have -- expectations.
No you didn't.  But he did change. Just not enough.
I care for her.
So talk to us about something.
How about your family?
I've almost finished the rocker. Did she order mirrors?
I thought she built it herself.
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
Shall I give you a few ideas?
For the inner satisfaction it will bring.  Saturday mornings, I'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --
For Jefferson High. For books.
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.
Morning Dick.
Hot tip,  Rubber Biscuit in the third race at Arlington.
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!
Are you all right, Marty? You seem a little...nervous.
I think I know exactly what you mean.
No, Chinese food is fine.
George, she's beautiful, right? She's nice, she's decent, she's the kind of girl you'd like to marry, right? And there's nothing in the world you'd like more than to take her to that dance, right?
What is that? A pencil that writes in ink?
Maybe if I used my left....
Yeah, explode it up your ass!
Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?
Who, me?
Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
I'm sorry, there's no answer.
March 11th.
The power of a million hydrogen bombs!  ...and we get twenty four measly volts. It's not fair! I've been working on this power converter since 1949, and you'd think in all that time, I could find the right chemicals that would efficiently convert radiation into electric energy! But no! Thirty three years of dedication and research, and all I've got to show for it is a bootleg video operation!
Eight thirty.
But Professor --
The appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he! You see, Shemp has just become the world's first time traveller. I've sent Shemp into the future -- two minutes into the future to be exact.
Pardon me?
4200 rads...  That certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.
Say, where did this guitar come from?
I know.
Where did you get this?
The test is this Monday! 15 megatons... Let's see, we need 4200 rads...  You'd have to be...exactly 800 yards from ground zero... You realize that what we're going to do could be extremely dangerous.
That's all taken care of.
Look. I'm a little worried about this -- this whole thing with my mother, he admitted to the Professor. I mean, I don't know if I can do it -- I mean, hitting on my own mother, that's pretty heavy.
That's just what I needed to hear.
You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky. Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda Triangle -- that was back in '64.
...He just lets himself get pushed around all the time! People walk all over him and he never fights back, never stands up for himself.
What did you do to your hair?
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
You promise to stay down there for an hour?
Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
What'd they look like?
You lost that one?
Then why'd you do it?
You know, before I met her, nobody could ask me how I was doing with my girl. Matter of fact, I didn't really have one.
I've got to stick by Kit... He feels trapped.
Doing what?
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
Nothing.
How do you say "Quit my Job" in Spanish?
You're a redhead.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
What a nice place.
My stomach's growling.
Somebody else is going to get it.
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
No.
Yes.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Never mind. It doesn't matter... If I'm worth a damn, I'll pick the right direction. And if I'm not, well, I don't care. See what I mean?
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
Hi, whatcha doing?
You're my friend, aren't you?
See, we're about out... been driving all night. Actually, I don't even have time to explain it to you.
Who are you?
Not me. No way.
See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...
Ever since that phony phone call from the President.  Look at this. What is it?
Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?
Running a little late, Buckaroo.
It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
Where're you goin'?
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
He offered you money?
Go away.  Let me rot?
Another 'you'?
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.
What's happening with my call to SAC?
Jammed--? By who? Whom by?
It's a spittin' image.
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
Well I have to come up with  an outline, I'd guess you call it. The story. The whole goddamn story. Soup to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-
Yes, I'm afraid I have.
Before what?
Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so to speak-
And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
I'll try to slip out. If he quiets down, passes out... I'm afraid he thinks  well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton. He becomes irrational
No, I  I didn't mean to sound 
How long you been up there, Fink?
...No. I never saw him with anyone else.
Could you come back later?  It's just...  too hot... My head is killing me.
...Huh? No, I'm 
Don't worry about it. It's just a B picture. I bring it in on budget, they'll book it without even screening it. Life is too short.
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
What do you think this is? HAMLET? GONE WITH THE WIND? RUGGLES OF RED GAP? It's a goddamn B picture! Big men in tights! You know the drill!
What do you do far a living?
Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night  if the show sells out.  Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.
Yes, generally, to see pap. However, point number two: A brief tenure in Hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays.
Go ahead, son.
What do you mean, Barton?
Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink.
... You got a glass? It's the least I can do.
...Is the egg showing or what?!
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying  a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by just being yourself.
...And look, I'm sorry as hell about the interruption. Too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other people in the world.
Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell me?  Can't trade my head in for a new one.
My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle.
Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself 
I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie. I'll miss you.
Barton. Are you all right?
Why don't we go to your room-
...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this?  What're we gonna do?
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
...I just don't know what... to do
It's more than I've got.
...Yes, thank you.
...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?
F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be you, huh?
L.A.P.D.
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. Talking about the Wallace Beery picture.
Yes, Colonel.
Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper.
Where were you tonight?
All night?
Yeah, I was drinking.
How about the coke?
No?
How's not smoking?
Yes.
What is this interest you've got in her?
She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
How long were you dating him?
How long were you having sex with him?
Yes, you do.
What's your new book about?
But you said you liked men to use their hands.
You like playing games, don't you?
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
I didn't.
My wife used to call me that.
Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine.
Why does he do it?
You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?
Why take the risk?
What did you think?
Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
Can I talk to you a minute?
You're not going to tell me what she's doing.  I thought we weren't playing games anymore.
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
I'm writing a book.
They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell.
Would you tell us the nature of your relationship with Mr. Boz?
You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
The answer is no.  I didn't kill him.
He was walking home from work. They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic.  Somebody drove by and shot him.
No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.
Thanks.
Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins?
No, sir.  You won't.  There's smoke off yonder on the horizon.  They're gonna want your badge.
Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
I'm not sure anymore she did it.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
Now what?
Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?
First you've got her buying your file.  Now you've got her killing Nilsen.  Forget her, willya?  Go someplace.  Sit in the sun.  Get away from this goddamn fog.  Get her out of your system.
Tell me again.  I want to hear you say it again.
Why do you think he's dead?
Who are you?
No Lisa Anderson, detective.
My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?
I'm a painter, too.
When's your show?
New York.
It's in New York.
You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks.
I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you."
Who is it?
Is Jean Michel here?
Jean, your parents are here.
It doesn't matter how much you worked on them. It matters how much you can get for them.
What do you mean?
I'm not black.
Yes, yes... Let's talk about that.... your roots... Your father is from Haiti, isn't he?
Yeah.
Who am I?
Your people.
Famous people are usually pretty stupid. You're too smart. You'd get bored to death. You don't wanna be like John Henry  fighting the machine. Just do what you do. It's about integrity. Follow your heart.
We got beat.
She's good.
... I'll buy you some new ones.
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
Basquiat, don't lie.  This is smack.
It looks done.
... babies.
I really... admire you.
What's your name, man?
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
That's a beautiful name. French?
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it  did your girlfriend leave you?
You heard of Albert Milo. I made that niggah. I'm Rene Ricard. Didn't you read "Not About Albert Milo?" I know who to hype. Baby, I'm gonna make you a star.
I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates.  But those big boys know how to fight. They could make you look real sissy.  I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything.  So what's your real name? 'Samo?'
Uh huhh... Band practice?  It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...?
So keep painting.
That one's for you.
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
You don't have any!!!
I need this?
Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
Where's the fire?
I can't sleep either, lately.  A little link, between us.  But bottom line baby, you live to preserve the peace, and I'm dying to disturb it.  That could put a strain on our relationship.
You're the second man who killed me this week.  But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left.
Didn't I say that?
You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
Well that's a ... long story ...
I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
You almost sound enthusiastic.
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
I, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
... What do we do?
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
"Oswald" is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
I am the light of this city.  <u>And</u> I am its mean, twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the "mayor"?
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
We're gonna disassemble his spiffy old Batmobile, then reassemble it as an H-bomb on wheels.  Capiche? Yesterday's victor is tomorrow's vapor.
Thanks.  Jeez.  Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number.
Son!
Ten, nine...
What, is that supposed to "hypnotize" me?
You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you.  And once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ...
Max!  Relax!  Josh and Jen'll put a spin on this.  We'll talk it over tonight, at your costume par--
Find my brother Wilfred.  Give him This.  I have duties he must fulfill in my stead.  Only family can be trusted.
He's over-eager, impulsive.  I can't trust him not to get hurt.
You have?
Is there something wrong, sir?
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.
It'll take the satellites about a minute to re-align, but...damn!
You were a great scientist once. Don't squander your genius on evil.
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
Pull back.  You can't make the jump.
She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then...
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
Umm-hmmmm.
How did you...?
We gotta get those locks changed.
No sign of the snowman.
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
And?
What happened to his wife?
You know Alfred.  He'd never say Anything.  But I can tell.  Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.  Without him, I don't know how I would have survived.  He saved my life, Dick.  And I've never told him.
McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had.
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
That's no batlight, it's a birdcall.
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
Trust me.  Vegetable magnetism.
I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals.  Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe.  The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them.  For we will be the only two people left in the world.
You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
What do we have here?  A lovely new supply of Venom.  I'll just take this to my laboratory for further study.
The dreams again, sir?
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
It's happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them.
Maybe they're right.
Why do I keep doing this?
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
Master, Bruce?
All the answers are numbers.
What do maniacs always want?
And another name for Mystery?
Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.
May I help you, Master Grayson?
You are direct, aren't you?
Mr...?
So glad you could come.
What? Oh, it's very impressive.
Psychiatrists make you nervous?
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.
It's a stretch but I'll manage.
To kill me.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
Fast work. You just moved here.
Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.
There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...
I don't-.
...Not the bat?
Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse.
Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back.
Edward...
Yet so bright and chipper and conservative!  It's so you.  And yet so _you_!  Very few people are both a summer _and_ a winter. But you pull it off nicely.
No.  Wait...
Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again.
Why do we need you? You only come between us. We can be the smartest person in Gotham City. We want the empire for ourselves. Time's up, laughing boy.
I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
How long's it been, Alfred? A quarter of a century?  It seems like yesterday. I guess we ended up doing more harm than good.
Can't we --
How much do you weigh?
How'd you find this place?
I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
Great.  Give me a grant.
"This is Miss Vale." -- That felt redundant.
See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.
Do you want a drink?
What did you see?
But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --
God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
I don't sing very well.
All street mimes should be executed.
I know it's late. I -- Are you there?
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
We'll raid the Ace the moment we get a warrant.
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
I missed you, Lieutenant.
That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
There was no blood, man.  My brother says... all the bad things you done... they come back and haunt you...
Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."
Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?
Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
And what happens if we say no?
All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
... Why the mask?
You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
How'd you know it was me?
Burned out.  I need a vacation.
Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.
Yum, yum.
Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
The guy's bats all right. He's bat shit crazy. He --  -- I can't believe it. I was right!!
HOLY SHIT!!
Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I think it ....
And what did you say?
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you.
shhh...
He's not too bad.  I can live with him.
He doesn't like to say much does he?
Big day today, huh? 78
Oh yes.
Everything okay, David?
He's just parking the Governor's car.
Look at all this - publicity expenditure ... catering ... all completely fictional ... back as far as June 93 ...
So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel.
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
So, why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.
Tomorrow.  You have a problem with that?
I think you're wrong, David.  She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.
I owe you a very serious apology, young man.  It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  I sincerely hope that you do not.
Maybe two cars.
They're pretty.  Learn it in the army?
Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about ....  oh, 20 minutes.
... in the distant future.
It is urgent, sir.
what a pleasure, Governor.  Welcome.
I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two.  Not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even know it'd been stolen!  I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you guys.
You know the thing I hate most about children?
Whoa! I think I just figured something out Beavis.
This sucks.
What a dork. Huh huh.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Actually, we just wanna watch TV...
Beavis, you butt-munch, this guy wants us to score with his wife. And he's gonna pay us. We can buy a new TV.
Ow! These chips suck.
Huh huh huh. That chick was talking about doing it.
This is dumb, let's find that chick.
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
Yeah, heh heh. Umm, isn't Seattle in Washington? Heh heh... 'cuz I was thinking maybe we could go see Hole.
I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
Oh yeah. Can you just take us to Washington? We're gonna meet her there and, you know, heh heh hmmm...
I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
Chief, you know that guy whose camper they were whacking off in?
Not on him, Chief.
OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it.
Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't as sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
She sure does.
Maybe I am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien!  I can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of New England.
She's ready.
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
We should be flattered that she wants to sell our house.
Wave at the lion.
Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty.
What?
Cabin fever, hon?
God, it's Jane Butterfield!
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.
That little girl saw us.
... Not what I expected when we walked through that door.
I feel really stupid.
Here's something.
Honey.  Let's go.
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
What...?
What time is it?
What?
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
<u>So</u> you, the dead, want me, <u>the</u> <u>undead</u>, to throw the live guys -- Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  So what's my cut?
Yes... or no?  Do you want the Deetzes out or in?
Just get some people out of our house.
Folks, be reasonable here.  I'm at your service.  You be the judge. I'm a harmless guy.  Try me.
No, you don't!  He does not work well with others.
The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture!  We've got some serious talking to do.
Tell the truth.
So, <u>never</u> let Beetle Juice out. Never.  Besides...  We're thinking about letting everyone stay... You and your father and mother can stay too.
You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
I don't know what that signal means.
God, you're anatomically correct!
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
Otho, you've got to help me get Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable.
Otho?
I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
What do you think, honey?
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
Where is your mother?
I was just trying to open the door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key.
Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!
Answer your mother.
They're... not here anymore.
Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody...
That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.
Okay?
Are they still here, Otho?
Well there's a Little Deetz at least.  Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?
Is this the key to the attic?
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
I'll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort.
... Were you going somewhere?
I would like to walk today.
Will you be leaving now, Robert?
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here.
Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
I hope you're comfortable.
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
Did you lose something?
I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
... And Ben is just mad about you - you've lifted his spirits so - it's just... Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us.
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
... Why... No, I don't think so...
Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him.
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
Oh, I like that very much.
I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
I know...  ... So are you, Chauncey ...  ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.
I just don't excite you at all... I don't know what you want... I don't know what you like...
To watch...? To watch me...?
Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
I see. Then one more quick question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business?
... Are you sure you like it?
I see.
Yes, it is very good!
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
Yes, when I was younger I had thoughts about public office... But I found, Chauncey - that I was able to contribute more as a private citizen... of course, my wealth provided me with considerable influence, but I've tried, believe me, not to misuse that power... It's extremely important, Chauncey, when one is in a position of eminence, that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country... The temptations are strong, and I've been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many, but I have tried to stay open to voices of the people... I have tried to remain honest to myself...
Certainly, Ben.
We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
... Sir?
Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to meet you.
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
What about money?
I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
Good morning, Louise.
Well, ain't that the truth...
Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ...  ... I 'spose I'd better gather up some breakfast for you...
Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening.
I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.
Yes... Of course, you know, Mr. Gardiner, that I always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests, I hope you don't object to that.
Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
... How long have you been living here?
Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?
Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook?
... Joe? Who's Joe?
Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?
The Old Man gave me nice television sets, this one has remote control.  He has one just like it.
You look much taller on television, Mr. President.
Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
I'm becoming quite attached to Chauncey - quite attached...  ... And so are you, aren't you, Eve.
Thank you, Greta.  I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.
... Maybe you should talk to somebody, darling.
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
... Would you take me on a tour?
But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?
Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'
Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
... So what does all that add up to?
The rank-and-file in the FBI feel he is FBI, but others feel he is a CIA man who knows how to destroy FBI files.
Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
Hello, I'm here about the ad.
Yeah, just an idea I had.
I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
Now?
I was, wasn't I?  I was John fucking Malkovich!  Take me back, Craig.
Why aren't you at work?
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
Suck my dick!
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
A better friend.
Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.
So how was it?
I know. I'm sorry...
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester.
Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
What?
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
No, wait! I like your tits.  I love your tits. I want to fuck you.
This is important!
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
You wanted to be partners with me?
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
You're glowing again.
But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
Hello, Don.
You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.
Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
No. Don't be an ass.
You can be John Malkovich.
Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
Vegas? What'd you think?
Impressions? Those are hard.
I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
What kind of circumstances?
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Says me. Do you dream often?
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
Anybody else?
Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?
You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
No! Don't harm the vessel!
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad.  Hi, are you Craig's wife?
And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
Yeah, I saw them
How do we do that?
Yeah?
Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
Yes. How did you know it was me?
I'd love to see your work.
That was incredible. You're brilliant!
This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.
Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!"  The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!"  Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!"  Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.
Sleepy suddenly.
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
You got to go sometime. You got to go out there by yourself sometime.
There ain't.
Folks came.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
No. Sorry.
What do you know about it? I sleep where I want.
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
CAN THEY GET IN HERE?
You don't sit with me!!
I had another dream last night.  The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
You on your way home?
They treating you right over at the Bodwins?
She gone like they say?
You grown.
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
Be here. In case.
They good whitefolks?
I want to work, Miss Lady.
No. I mean work work.
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
Back stiff?
Could be that fall you took.
She likes to see you off in the morning.
She likes this dress...
I know what I see.
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
It's her, ain't it?
Well, who can tell what went on in there? I never even knew who Sethe was or none of her people.
What run him off? Tell me that!
You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.
He knew Baby Suggs?
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
You planning to do anything about it?
I was there Paul D...There in the yard. When she did it.
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.
Look here..There's a cross up there, so I guess this here's a church or used to be. Seems to me like you ought to show it some respect, you follow me?
Her life is in your hands.
This is our concern, Dude.
A dick, man!  And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!  VEE TAKE YOUR MONEY!
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!
What the fuck is he talking about?
Sheesh.
Yeah Walter, what's your point?
Kill that poor woman.
Who has your undies, Walter?
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity.
No, they--
1972 Pontiac LeBaron.
Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I gotta get back.
This is quite a pad you got here, man.  Completely unspoiled.
White Russian, thanks.  How's the smut business, Jackie?
Which one was Logjammin'?
Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?
Oh yeah?
"Johnson"?
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
From who?
Dieter Hauff?
Please Jeffrey.  I don't want to be responsible for any delayed after- effects.
Jeffrey--
Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--
What's your point, Walter?
What the fuck are you--
Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it is no dream.
Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck herself.  Why can't she board it?
Hey man--
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
Am I wrong!
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call--
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies--
Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a fucking game, Walter--
Oh shit.  Walter.
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about that poor woman?  What do we tell--
That's it.  I'm out of here.
You don't know, Walter?  You seem to know the answer to everything else!
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.
Thanks Walter.
They kept saying they believe in nothing.
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your homework, Larry?
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to--
Huh?
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
Yeah, and you were--
It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her fucking dog.  Going to her fucking synagogue.  You're living in the fucking past.
AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!
Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.
There weren't any shots.
Call the medics, Dude.
We're scattering the fucking ashes!
WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
Dude, this is Smokey.  Look, I don't wanna be a hard-on about this, and I know it wasn't your fault, but I just thought it was fair to tell you that Gene and I will be submitting this to the League and asking them to set aside the round.  Or maybe forfeit it to us--
Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want us to go?
Yeah.
Another Caucasian, Gary.
Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.
Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together-
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  I mean, if your wife owes--
'Scuse me?
Fuckin' A.
Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.
Who the hell is he?
Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
This guy fucking walks.  I've never been more certain of anything in my life!
Bullshit. Walter!
You come all the way down here to roust--
Whatta we do about the Mex?
Why?
What about Nomak?
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
Blade.
Each day is a little life.
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
It means "bloodbrother."
I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
And so will we.
Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.
You want me to hunt them for you.
Hey, hey!  The fuck you doing?!
I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?
You worry too much, Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
I see from your questionnaire that you don't have any immediate next of kin?
Whistler!
She's been bitten.
Stupidity.
It's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, of course, is to be like you, "the Day-walker".
Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
But he's a policeman --
Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.
What are you looking at?
So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
It's dark in here.
I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
How could you be a part of this?
This isn't human blood.
What happens then?
So what do you use, then? A stake?
Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
We keep in radio contact.
How did you escape?
I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.
Try, please, Anna--
What, are you alright?
What're you doing there?
Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.
Something was wrong.
No!
What's she look like?
Druid Hill Park.
Cheery little place.
Whatzername--the "psychic" Anna hired.
--<u>myth</u>--
No.
--chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents. It's called vandalism.
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
Anna--
You want me to scooch over next to you?
--or someone--
We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--
I don't know what it is, but there is something <u>happening</u> here, and it's starting to scare the living shit out me, and look, I'm just <u>not</u> going to argue the point anymore--you want to stay here, stay, but I've got to get the fuck out of here, and I'm begging you to come <u>with</u> me.
Then I'm going--
Are you marked like this??
<u>This</u> is what you wanted enhanced?
I know you're in there, you piece of shit!
<u>One</u> set. Everything from midnight on--
Does it hurt?
Okay, a blur.
Can't you like just divine it?
I don't believe this.
What I never could figure about the movie?
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
Whatta you got, telescopic vision?
Where's Domini?
Same trees. They took Elly Kedward out to the same kind of trees.
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
It's <u>freezing</u>.
What the fuck--??
Yeah. Me too.
Be it still alive, James?
Who?
--it's the "Blair Witch Cult"--a copy-- some pages from--one of them on the site must've gotten my message--
This is her equally on-the-rag boy- friend, Nick Leavitt--
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
--Cotter--
403 41st Street, kids: home.
Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?
What--
--whatever you want, no problem--
It's Domini, it's not Domini, I don't care--all I know is <u>I'm</u> not dealing with something--<u>anything</u>-- snuffing me in my sleep. I want to do what we did in the woods-- surveillance of this whole place 24/7, with somebody monitoring those cameras every second. There's something, somebody here, I want to see 'em coming.
Just let it go, I've got you!
What is all this shit?
Why?
--sacred and occult Scotch Tape.
What?
Ripped? They look like they were <u>bit</u> off.
Pointless.
Women miscarry all the--
For a blur?
Cotter'll kill you.
What is it you thought you saw on that tape?
Elly Kedward?
What're you afraid's going to happen?
The good old days: toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch.
She <u>wasn't</u> a witch.
--I know!
Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--
What?
Gothic rune--the letter "S."
She's far from "fine."
What the fuck's going on here?
Could I tell him what it's regarding?
....Ma'am?
Your mother's pastor.
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved.
Why d'you wanna leave all this?
Where... where you going?
On the phone. Was it for you?
I could've sworn I heard something.
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
Hello?
Ray?... What time is it?
...I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads.
Well... what happened?
...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe a burglar broke in, and you found--
If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra?
It'll pass.
What night is it?
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
Well now you do.
...What was that back there?
What did you take these for?
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
Now that don't make much sense.
...That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love--
...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it.
...There's a big--
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.
Dead, huh?
...Count it if you want.
Deuce in the corner needs help.
What's this?
That's not the point.
Howdy stranger.
Tuesday is ladies' night.
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
Suave. goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Frank?
Yes, but.
He's comin' back?. What for?
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name?. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
THEN WHAT?
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Don?
Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.
Do you like me?
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
Who is Don?
Are you a bad boy?
I'm glad you do.
Yes.
I'll call you.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
No thanks.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
What happened to him?
I've gotta go in.
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?
You want a Dairy Queen?
You saw a lot in one night.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
Okay. be careful.
What am I going to do?
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Okay.
Oh my God. What's wrong?
My father has a gun at home.
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone. the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
Hi Dad.
Are you feeling okay?
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
Thanks a lot, Mom.
I'm going out for awhile.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
God. you scared me.
Nothing. I'm fine.
No.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Sandy? ...Sandy, please.
What are watchin' this junk for?
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
Come on out a minute, okay?
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I am Augusto Oliveras.
Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie.  Why don't we start small?
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
Nothing like this back home.
Honey, your nose!
You wanna split?
I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
Surprise.
You can't sell this to your friends.
You can't sell this to your friends.
I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
The coca is my responsibility!
You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.
What can I do for you guys?
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
What can I do for you guys?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
The way we figure it, Barbara flies to Boston twice a week.  Two bags per flight.  Twenty-five pounds in each bag.
Goodness.
Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?
It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.
Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited me.
I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
Twenty-six months.
Oh my G-d.
Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?
But you must.  It's the only way.
This is only part of the business, George.  A very small part.  Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you.  I must go to Colombia.
George, good to see you, my brother.
Where do I put this!?
Are you comfortable with this?
Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't telling you.  It's just business.  Now, shut up.  You're driving me crazy.
Nothing.  Todo esta bien.
Cocaine?  How much?
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell him he's not welcome here.
Layaway shmayaway.
So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems.
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
Freedom.
Sure.
Money.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
I know.
What are you going to do?
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
I meant every word of it.
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
Hello.
Do I know you?
Jesus Christ.
Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.
Not in front of the kid.
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
She's getting big.  Getting her own ideas.
Is she here?  Is she coming?
What are you doing here?
Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?
Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see what it's like.  I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday.  Thursday after school.
It's a four-man operation.  Two on the ground.  Two in the air.
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
It's not enough.
Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we start?
Holy shit, Dulli!
Nice weed, huh?
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
This is bullshit, George.  We're never going to find anything down there.
They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.
Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
It is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war; from terrorism, one passes to insurrection ... as from open guerrilla warfare one passes to real war, the latter being the determining factor ...
The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
With an unloaded pistol?
I don't do that kind of thing.
Can you read?
It's good nobody is following us ...
What do you think of the strike, Ali?
No ...
What is she saying?
How you doin' Mister D?
Charlie -- are you going to make a point soon?
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
You did a good job, Charlie.
An inquiry into what?
Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day.  Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?
What can we prove?
Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.
What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
-- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
I've got work to do.
What's happening to you, Frank? You're acting like you're on trial here.  This has become personal to you.
Objection!
Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?
Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition?
Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney John Cardenas.  You arrived at what time tonight?
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
Doctor Trammel, when did you first diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart disease?
Mr. Roston, what was your relationship with Miss Lawson?
She told me that tonight we were going to open new doors.  I asked her to stop -- to take off the handcuffs, but she wouldn't listen.
What happened after that?
Why?
What kind of information?
Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot?
You can suggest anything you want. It happened.
I may have been infatuated with her - - but I wouldn't perjure myself.
I'm sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked.
Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice?
Why does she come to you?
October twenty-seventh.
Did you go to college, Mrs. Crawford?
Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan Paley?
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
-- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?
Did he make your life miserable?
I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along.
Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?
Who told you that?
Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago.
And you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you?
--and that he changed his will?
Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
Yes.
What do you have in your purse?
I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.
Yes.
Yes.
Do you think I did it?
I'm used to being on the outside looking in.  The same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together.
Have you ever seen animals make love, Mr. Dulaney?  They have such passion -- such savage emotion.  They struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other.  Not really.
When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road.  I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries.  It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes.  The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down.
This is your house.
What do you think?
I'm the photographer.
Hello?
Yeah.
I called you all weekend.  Where were you?
You were brilliant today.
She's right, Paley.  You've got to kill me.  She doesn't have to -- she's free -- she can't be tried again -- but you, you planned it with her.  You supplied the Coke.  You're an accessory to murder.
Alright, I'll talk to her
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch.  Do you?
You're on vacation, remember?  You're supposed to be relaxing.
If you want me to.
She sounds like quite a woman.
Why don't you talk to him now?
This isn't a courtroom.  Don't try to turn this around on me.
Albert's got the stomach flu.
No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.
Not even if they're a dork?
Did Marsh use it?
Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
Well, I can help.
Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
Explain to me again why we didn't do this in Des Moines in an air conditioned office?
He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?
Yeah.
My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.
I can't believe she's making jokes.
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
Carolyn!
Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.
No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
Are you supposed to be in Iowa?
Roseman Bridge?
If I'm not taking you away from anything.
Oh. When did you move back?
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
This time of year.
Oh there you are.
Are you by nature a sadistic person?
Where are you staying while you're here?
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
Feeling better?
Is the dizziness gone?
I better go. You sure you're all right?  It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
Then what happened?
You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes?
Why doesn't it scare you?
But no one in particular.
But it's not the same.
No, I'm just saying --
Listen, I'm sorry I --
Francesca?
I'll pick you up.
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
Yes.
I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
Why do you say that?
Uh-huh. And?
What are you doing?
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
Now?!  It's after eleven.
Want anything special for dinner?
Okay.
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
When did she decide this?
It clearly states in the will --
Outta my way, boy.  Cinnabar?  I'm coming!
Your father was his best friend.  He loved Jeremiah.  So he must hate him the most of all now.  He'll take his time. But even if it is too late.  If your father is dead.  It's not over.  The door has to be closed.
We practically paying him for the privilege of playing his club.
Bones!  How baddass is zat?  This is the place for us.  Patrick, you get platinum props, man.  Platinum.
Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
You want us to move in here?
Tia ain't a chick.  She's family.  And don't forget it.
No.  Well, yeah.  Maybe just a little.
Yeah, we can.  Least till after this weekend.  He ain't going nowhere.  We'll deal with it then.
Where's the gangsta of love?
You tell my old friend Mackie, I'll be seeing him.  Soon.  Real soon.
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
No?  That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now?  Kill us? Kill us all?
Jimmy, you've got --
It's all arranged for tonight.  Eddie Mack's gonna be there.  And Offisa Korruptsky, too.
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
Wait, Jimmy.  Think about it.  You woulda done the same thing if you was me.
You know I can't.
...I've seen things.  In there.  Last night.  You did too.  Don't tell me you didn't.  You were crying like a baby.
I lied.
Eddie Mack, that cop.  And Jeremiah.  And even when he's done, who knows.  He won't be satisfied.  Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more.  Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied.
The dead get out?
She doesn't want me here.  With you.  In this house.
Patrick, he's...
We gotta jump!
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
Why?  Why did you give a shit about the building?  Why did you care that we were there of all places?
Help me.  I'm so sorry.  But please, help me...
No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
Fair enough for the shit.  But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.
What it is?  What it will be, muthafucka.
I know it.  The old slaughterhouse.  Hey, Sal.  That little weasel we popped today?  He's got something for us.  I knew he would once he thought about it.
12-year olds.  They scare easy.  Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash.  Come with me.
We just thought...
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
And damp, too.  Let's not forget damp.
Why not?  He eats everything else.
Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?
Illibent?  Who's club is that?
Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.
So Caesar, what did it total out at?
Where is this going, Johnnie?
We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.
She's doing the work herself.
Where the hell's the laundry detergent?
That doesn't make any sense.
It couldn't have been.
If you're not with me, Violet, then I have to assume you're against me.
Where is the money?
Stupid cunt!
I saved you.
Now that's teamwork.
How's it going tonight, fellas?
Fuck, this happened before.  It's this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm sorry.
You planned this whole thing, didn't you?
How many'd you do?
Now, where the fuck is my money?
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
Cease, can I ask you something?
Ma'am, you have to open the door.
This is a beautiful place.
Yeah.
I should be going.  You can drop the cup off anytime.
I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I shouldn't have called...
Curious, maybe.
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
I wanted to apologize.
How did you meet him?
How long have you been with him?
I'm glad you did.
I don't.
We make our own choices and we pay our own prices.  I think we're more alike than you want to admit.
Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.
I want out.  I want a new life.  I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.
These people are serious, Violet. If you want to know how serious, ask Shelly.  They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules.  You fuck them, you've got to do it right.
What?
And where is it now?
All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
What did Gino drink?
And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.  -- and shatter against the hardwood floor.
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
Oh, thank God.
Hey.
Done.  We go now.
You shouldn't have to see this.  Why don't you get out of here?  Go for a walk.
She's a gypsy.  If it's a cover, it's a great one.
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
-- he went inside! --
You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
I won't ask again.
What do you mean?
What is Treadstone?
<u>What did you do to me</u>?
I know you've been trying to kill me.
Jason Bourne is dead.
Keep it. 
I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  How does it feel to be dead?
Who do you think sent me?
It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.
Please.  I don't want to scare you.
Jesus...
I said ten thousand.
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
Look, go ahead...put the radio on...
-- you could put it together --
Okay, so you're a victim.
People do amazing things when they're scared.
Slow down.  No, don't stop.  Just...
Four-fifty.  That's the address...
I should go.
-- no -- Marie -- <u>no</u>! -- it's not like that --
-- let me do this, okay? --
I trusted you.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
-- we'll explain it --
Yes.
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
He run away often?
Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down.
-- Miss Kreutz, please --
And that's the best angle of the courtyard?
-- let's check that Interpol window again --
What the fuck is he doing?
What?
-- what're you talking about? --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
You're awake.  Can you hear me?  You've been shot.  I'm trying to help you.  You were in the water.  You've been shot.  It's okay now.
You're on a boat.  A fishing boat. Italian flag.  We're out of Vietri.  It's the cold that saved you.  The water.  The wounds are clean.  I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  It's clean.
It came from your hip.  Under the skin.  You have a bank in Zurich.  You remember Zurich?
...ervices.
What have you got there?
Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ... Tuttle
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ...
Yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it seems she was killed resisting arrest.
Sam!
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
What's the matter?
You are late.
Hello, Jack!
{winking at Sam) She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.
What?
Layton! Oh shit!
What's she done?
Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
Jack?... Jack?
Where do I get it stamped?
You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
You think these are tits don't you?
Where are you taking me?
Look at that - right on time.
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop! 
This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
Please, Jill ... I love you.
Jill! What are you do ... I mean ... how did you ... Are you alright?
Don't you like parties?
Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.
But if they did promote you
It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again.
Try next of kin.
Here. What do I do next?
Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
That's it.
Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?
I never signed the form.
What! Shit!
No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on!  Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
What?
Sod it, it's broken!
You remember Samuel, my son.
I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.
Actually, Alma, that's one of the little things I was dying to tell you ... Sam's been promoted to Information Retrieval.
Uh ...
Whatever happened to you?
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
Put the phone down and your hands up.
Er, don't you want to search me?
Are we?
I don't know which numero.
Yes?
But we can get one.
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?
Sign here please.
What is it?
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
Thank you very much. How much will it...?
No underwear?
She asked me to pick her up.
I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories.
Red Death?  Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.
So, Frank, am I going to live?
See, I can't do it. I came out of the desert.
You're not going to die.
Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
Is he going to be alright?
He's very very sick.
Is there any chance?
It's my first cigarette in over a year.
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
He's dead, huh?
I think this place stinks.
Did you see my father?
Sleeping.
Not as good as Nino's.
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
Don't seem so bad to me.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside?
Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.
Backup?
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
The family know?
I'm sorry.
It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering.
The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital.
Whadda we bring?
Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us--
No we can't. He's got a pulse.
Turn it off.
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
You're in the stomach! Let me try.
Stomach again.
One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you.
Okay if I watch you tape that interview downstairs?
...outlaw nation but strangely those who have interviewed Gaddafi find him, in a phrase we like to use in this country, very 'presidential'.
Keep it to yourself.
Shut up a second...
I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.
Everybody has one like that.  I thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end.
I don't think so.
Okay.
It's Mr. Buddy Felton?
Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.
They didn't hire Peter Stiller from the <u>Times</u> and he had a great audition tape.
I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less and less air time.  They don't think I'm at all anchor material.
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
What happened?
Well, whatever you think.
Yes.
Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much?  Wow...Okay...See you there...
Did you bring your grey suit?
Do you feel good about it?
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
Don't go.
Aaach...Jane...  Let's take the part that has nothing to do with me.  Let's let me be your most trusted friend, the one that gets to say awful things to you.  You know?
You were quick enough to get Tom's help when...
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
I don't know if we have any younger man more respected in our operation than you.
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?
Aaron, I've never seen them like this -- I think Paul's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to...
Do it then.
Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
We came from Washington.
Okay.  I just wanted you to know.
Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, I'm going to have to bring you up here to New York.
Yeah, I know, I went back and forth on it.
Tell George and Jessica to try and cover everything without Tom having to ask additional questions.
I've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me.  I'm in no rush for anything.  It's just the snotty attitude, even if I have it coming, it's still...
I wish it were you giving the story.
Okay.  And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information.  Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
Jane -- For God's sake...  Look, it's time for you to go to sleep.
You know, Tom, I feel a little proud when people comment on your looks.  Maybe you should feel that way.
As long as that's your only problem you're...
Hi.
Another thing I can't stand is ...when White House reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as "White House" sources say...
I never told you the reason I was telling you everything for.
They said it would be okay if...
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
So he was indicted?
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
Jane?
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
So you like me, huh?
It's incredible who's here.
Hi, again.  Sorry about...
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
Then give me a minute...
You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
What a great surprise.  I didn't think we had a chance.  I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
This is very awkward.
You're saying stay away from him.
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
I just need you for another minute now, so we can shoot from behind towards me, and, um...
That's not true I am a sculptor!
If you were an artist you could have created something!
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
It's kind of dark -
Look -  This pose is all wrong!
What did he do?
You think she's better than Murdered Man?
More champagne, your majesty?
May I please have another little kiss?
It's true, isn't it?
Nice night out...
Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
No.  Why don't you cover it up Walter...
What's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?
Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
Would you pose for me for free?
I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not like a banker, you know.  Like I create.
Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series...
Man look at that get up !
Man if you want to be a legit artist you have to do nudes, nudes, nudes...
Well...why did you put a knife in it?
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
It's hot in here...
A show..how soon can we go?
What offers have you got for it? I won't be out-bidded.  I'm a wealthy man and I don't mind paying for something I want.
What do you want for it?  Two thousand? Three thousand?
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse!  Junk!  Heroin!
Who do think you're dealing with, huh?  I'm willing to cut you a break, chief!
Wait a minute - I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
Well I'm overjoyed.
Are you done with these?
Maxwell.
And what project looms on the horizon, Walter?
An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...
It's like...you've turned on.
T-tell him that?
Good night Walter...
Uh, Mrs. Swicker I got to meet some friends later, and I have to take a shower!
I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.
Don't grab me, okay?
Buffy!  Looking tasty.
It's coffee.
I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
What show is this?
Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
Come on, what was it?
Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat.
So that's your tutor, huh?  What is he, like, your boyfriend now?
Ah, my fool is dead.  He was careless, always.  Still, I'll pull out your tongue for that.  Don't you understand?  I've killed you a dozen times.  Your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath.  I have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  A thousand years, and more. I have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and I have bathed in the blood of emperors.
Will you guys shut up, please?
Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name?
How are you doing?
Where are you gonna go?
Things are kind of confusing.
Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
Thanks.
I been working on some stuff for you.  What'cha doing?
He did what he was supposed to.
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
Leave me alone.
I crashed your party.
That's me.
Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
I'm going out the front.
Are you okay?
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
Like what?
Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.
I'm glad you guys are here.  It's good to see you.
You look way pretty, Kim.
Am I in trouble or something?
I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.
Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
Just stay away from me, okay?
I can't believe I'm doing this.  I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.
Wait a minute.
All right.  What do we do now?
It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
Here?
No -- you don't have to --
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
You are such a wet.
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
Interesting.
There isn't time.
Another distraction.  It's not right.
Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
Wait!
-- like she's gonna kill me.
I don't get it.
Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
Pike.
So very much.
What... are you?
Listen, you little worm.  I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that?  You got that?
I got all the plastic stuff.  What should I do with it?
She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
I never thought of that.
They'll kill us!
Oh, yeah!
Smell of booze much.
What are you talking about?
Oh, thank you very much.
And the January Semi-formal --
Ah, you'll be coming back.
You mean Nuke.  You said "Crash".
God I'm tired.  What a trip I was lousy.  I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  I--
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
This in ridiculous.  I'm a pro.
Death is like spring training?
I'm yours.
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
Just till I lose.
I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
I gotta leave first thing in the morning.
I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap.  I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in the "sweet spot", voting every election, soft core pornography, chocolate chip cookies, opening your presents on Christmas morning rather than Christmas eve, and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last for 7 days.
Damn.
Your place or mine?
A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
And he's right!  A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often.  You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are!  And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
...  so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?
Ninety-five miles an hour.
Thanks for the note--you're right, I wasn't bending my back.
Well--you boys stopped fighting yet?  Are you pals now?  Good.  I love a little macho male bonding-- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being "re-channeled" but I believe in "re-channeling" so who cares, right?  Shall we go to my place?
Good--then listen.  "I sing the body electric.  The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them--"
You missed the tag!
Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
"To announce your fucking presence with authority"?  This guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  He's looking for heat.
Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
He did know.
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
"Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
I love winning, Crash, you hear me?  I love It.  Teach me everything.
Write this down.  "We gotta play 'em one day at a time."
What's wrong?
Good.  Good.  That's terrific...
You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?
She's playing with my mind.
Who you calling a "boy"?
Hi, Jimmy.  Want a ride?
Where's Ebby?
You guys lollygag the ball around the infield, ya lollygag you're- way to first, ya lollygag in an' outta the dugout.  You know what that makes ya  Lollygaggers.  What's our record, Larry?
Hi, Ace.
That's right.
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
You were wandering around.
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog.
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that?
...stupid things.
Fine, fine. How's your family?
Okay, Randy. Thank you.
Hello.
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
Dad!
Mommy.
It was eight.  Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game.
Ohh!
...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas.
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  Do you believe this shit?
Hey, Ace.
You think he got the point?
Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
You lost your control.
Yes, you lost your control.
All right.
Yeah.
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
That's right, yeah.
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses.
...on the line and this guy's out havin' the time of his life. He has every cop in the state watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf.
...hundred yards further down the road.
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
What are you doin'? You gotta get out of here!
She's there with you?  She's there with you?
Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.
You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis.
Hello.
...trying to offer you the respect that your...
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
I had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week.
Why not make them happy?
Fuckin' asshole won't budge.
Okay, thank you for asking.
The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
Okay.
If not for me, at least for Amy.
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
I mean she's only sober about two hours a day. It's usually from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon. And if I gave her her money and her jewels now, you know what she's gonna do? She's gonna piss it all away in about a year, and then where will she be?  Where would you be then? Comin' right back to me, right back to me.  Or finding some other excuse to come and I - I -
Hello.
Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what?  Around ten thousand?
To the Riviera.
Why do you want to do that?
All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
Oh...
Get - Get up! Get up!
She, she's alone. Just go. Take the gun and go into Amy's.
Should I let her in like - ?
It won't happen again, Sam.
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
...worst possible time for me.
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You gotta go back out there.
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
Go back inside! This is none of your business!  I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore.
I'm just trying to get in my house!
Um, I'm gonna need a bag. If you could just ask the guy for a big bag, okay?
Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.
Hey!
Hey, Mr Rothstein, it'll make it a lot easier on everybody here if we just let her in the house.
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
He's not here?
Artie! Artie!
We're - we're placing you under arrest for -
It's in all the papers.
You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
You got a round figure on it?
Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here']
Fine.
Sure.
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
Listen, Ginger... you know, this is probably not... I don't have the answers anyway... and this is probably not what you want to hear right now, because you're a little upset with Ace.
He gives a fuck what I do?
You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.
I didn't.  I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back.
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
...same outfit.
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean?
He's sittin' by the phone -
- back to  Nigeria.  Yeah.
There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
Yeah.
Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
Yeah, thanks a lot.
...bosses. I mean, they're smokin' their Di Nobilis and they're eatin' a trippa [Italian-American slang for 'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you know, fried pigs guts? While, if I wanna talk private, I gotta go to a fuckin' bus stop.
He's here.
You must have drunk too much.
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
Don't know.
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
No more fuckin' dirty work!
Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.
Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name!
Charlie M?
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...
That's enough.
I know, but that's enough.
...done right, you gotta do it yourself.
Hi.
Yes, uh...
The crowd bought it.
I thought we were going to take it easy until the Mission...
You know, nobody likes you...
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
I despise these kind of winds. Sorry, I guess I'm a little on edge. Seems this Catwoman has everyone, men and women, on edge. Don't you feel Catwoman says something about the duality of all men and women...
A whip?  Now that's going too far!  Some of these women have no shame!
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
I thought you said you weren't a very good liar.
Selina, are you okay?
We're waiting.
I can. That's not an admission of guilt,  It's just..I knew you had it in you...
I've been looking for you.
You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
Will you please stop fighting?  Just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together!  Trust me, one day we'll look back on this day and laugh. You got to admit, it's a lot more fun to be the villain.
The shopkeeper on 13th street won't drop the lawsuit--He still claims one of the lasers we fired at the Jenkins gang burned down his store..
Not now, Mammoth. Adonis is right. We've had a good run here--the protection kickbacks from the crime syndicates, the merchandising scams-- Tomorrow night we have a big, violent, complicated and lucrative mission to pull off. We chould be resting up.
Cactus--shooting a man in the back is not very noble.
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
I don't know, Boss, you saw what the big guy did to the last kitty we gave him.
Car wash, Captain?
My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the "Wild" side..
I want out of tonight's mission. I can't do it anymore, Captain. I can't let innocent people die to prove our superiority..I can't.
A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke.
My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
You think so?...Selina?
Oh no, not a computer disc. A computer disc?  Oh man, come on, what do I look like?  I'm not a crime- fighter, I'm not a detective, what, I'm supposed to find some "clues" on this disc. I can't...
You Housewives have no idea what we go through!
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
I don't know what came over me.
Sorry, I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone, I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging..
Good morning.
Like you don't know...
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
You are...
Some reporter I am..all this time my story is right there in front..I have a lot of questions.
Lose the smile, Mr. Good Reflexes. We were having a pretty okay time the other night--good food, good conversation--some Catwomen show up and it's "You need cab fare?; I got to go to my Hideout--Oh, I'm sorry, I mean "warehouse."
I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
I know.  But it's an emergency. Somebody dying.  Okay?
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
I know he's there!  He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.
What if they do question the authenticity?
I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
Will you two cut it out?
You gotta just look the other way.
Are you guys all right?
What's this?
You missed.
How do we get back to the freeway?
Yeah, I suppose getting whacked has got to be one of your best ways to die.  Particularly if you're not expecting it.  You don't know what hit you.
Which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law.  These are people who don't worry about reading you your rights.
I prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location.  Once Nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies.
That's your "rep."
What do you mean tip the cops?  Is the man a lunatic or what?
That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
I thought you said you could handle him.
Lose the hardware now.
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
Sure.  And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
You're the one who's not to be believed.
Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
Fine, no tunnel.  Are you still with me?  Hello?
What do they need her for?
"Theo?"
26th off Wilshire.
Will you please speak to me! Theo?
Hello?  It's just me and you again.
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
What's happening?
He's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him.
You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?
What bank?
Not a chance.
They'll recognize it's not your husband.
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
You can't give up.
Yes sir.
Lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions.  We're almost there.  Simply get out when they slide the van open and walk to me.
Don't start thinking about it.  Is the tape off?
They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
It's locked.
And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it.  I probably killed some poor bastard for it.
We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
What's that supposed to me?
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
Any idea where you're going?
You've had a lot of fun with me today.  What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion.
Just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again.  No harm admitting I fell in love with the sound of you.
I've got ... one last number for you, Theo ...
My fence in San Francisco ... 305-4410.  Maurice.  Don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds.
Who are you working for?
Twenty percent.
You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison.  He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
Pass.
What time frame have you got in mind?
There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
It's in the process.
I'm opening the side door.  She'll step out.  But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back.
Stop the crying.
Yeah.  Why don't we?
Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
You researched me.  You know where I live.  She'll be waiting for you there along with your split.
What does it take to kill you?
I can see the benefit in that.
Where do I turn?
Better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them.
Probably as close to the Getty as I'll ever come.  Unless you care to be my "patron," Nels.  You wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts.
Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.
Seems not.
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
I thought so.
So let's call this the usual.
He's what she should run a mile from.
What you think?
Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col.
That's what he said. Jimmy.
Good thing in a man.
Thank you.
Jimmy.
Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --
Fuck off back to Essex!
You American?
Perform?
Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it?
Jesus Christ!
That Dave?
Would you like a drink?
He lived here with you?
As different as it's possible to be.
Do I?
What does that mean?
You mean that?
Come on, Dil --
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
You could?
Made me feel all funny inside.
So I'm sorry.
I should have known, shouldn't I?
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
So I got it wrong, then.
What you doing, Jimmy?
Do you like me even a little bit?
Why?
Come on...
So tell me.
What pills?
Are you all right, Dil?
You killed my Jody
You tried.
See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.
More endearments.
Tell me you love me.
What was that she called you, Jimmy?
She was --
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
Can't help it. You're doing time for me. No greater love, as the man says. Wish you'd tell me why.
What was it?
Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil?
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
Eddie and Tinker died.
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
You're his keeper. If you don't mind him seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the only one he looks at.
What the fuck is this?
Yes.
You OK about that?
He's at home.
And who is she?
Thank you, handsome.
What's that?
Shut the fuck up, would you?
Didn't look like that to me...
C'mere.
No?
You make a nice couple.
I got sent.
It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.
Best game in the world.
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well.
See? I was right about you.
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
Who's Dil?
Do you?
You liked her?
Don't know her.
Take the whole lot. I won't need it.
Help me.
Go to sleep now.
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?
Take the hood off, Fergus --
Faster than cricket?
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
I never know nothing.
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.
Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children. I know who's got the money 'n I ain't disappearing till I got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day.
You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
What are you talking about?
Oh!
What?
Adam!
You don't look so bad in this light.
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
What is it?
Yes, you told me.
Reggie -- I think I've found --  are you on?
as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 --  no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- lyses! Adam -- that was it! The garden!
You didn't have to chase me so hard --
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency.
Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.
Ours.
I believe you.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband.
Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
Carson?
Caf.
Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
That's a face you don't forget -- he was there too --
Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
Sorry about that.
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
Carson Dyle is dead.
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Who told you to do that?
Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.
He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
I think Tex did it.
What's so illogical about that?
No sense messing up the streets.
Hm?
What are you doing?
Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.
I don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.
Why don't you shut up!
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
The money is unimportant.
In your money, perhaps $65,000.
The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
No -- in my room.
Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will I win a prize?
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
I don't know -- how would I know?
Peter Joshua.
Good for you.
I'm not sure I --
Oh. I guess.
Yes, but we're divorced.
Is your husband with you?
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
Are you in the book?
What are you doing here?
How did you find out?
Instant divorce you mean?
Come on. You can't stay here.
We'll find you a hotel.
I'm still having trouble with English.
Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
On the street where you live.
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
Nothing. Good night.
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
So they think he left it with you.
Who is it?
What'd he say?
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
You know what I want, Miz Lampert...
It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.
Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
What is it about?
Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
I don't see him.
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.
It's almost ten o'clock.
Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss.
A little.
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
I'm not.
No!
We're seeing all the signs in town.
Hello?
She's not here.
I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
Pay no attention to me.
You fucked me up!
Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you.
You aren't going to the party?
_ Your father raped someone?
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
No!
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
You ok?
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
Don't you think it's sick?
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
Are you O.K.?
What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
Mom?
I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
Did he say anything else about her?
No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
Kenny's aunt?
On what side of the family?
What?
Dylan's been telling people that Annette gave him a blow job.
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
Maybe it won't stay in.
Let me just ask you a serious question first.
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
Unfair?!
 Oh, shit.
Where do you want this stuff?
Great. 
Oh.
Wait, wait.  You don't believe the dead guy, do...
Then you drive me to McGrud-...
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
...-ed.

No cell.
Billings?  No, no, no, no, no.  We need to go to McGruder.
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.

We can't push old Pete in this heat.  He can't take it.
Ah, one of them's in the back.
...work!  It's not even load-...
Get him to stand up, Night Shift.
I was thankin' you, asshole!
Probably because they know a psycho when they hear one.
...waiting!
Oh, shit.
I think...
Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!
 Okay.
 I should've had that dog bite me.  I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse!
Go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, shit.
Get over!  Get over!
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
Come on.
Come on...
What the fuck was that?!


All right.
 Okay.  Okay. 
Yeah, he's a dangerous...

I don't want you to come anyway. 


This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
...did you?
Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
...shit.
Not completely, anyway.
 
Ow!  
Go!
Stop.
Oh, fuck!
Oh, shit.
Whoo!
What?

Hang on, hang on.
We're the shit.  Bigtime.
Stop limpin' around like that.
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
 Yeah.
...-tiatin'.
Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
I was undercover as a tennis player.
My code name was Blackjack.  Night Shift was my coach.  Uh-Uh-Uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach.

I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's...
Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.
But...
Vaughn.
...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck?
Yeah, that's my truck.
So you called the damned thing Elvis
...here.   Mason... 
You got a prob-...
Well, why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here?!
Listen, deputy.
We've got it...
All right, gentlemen. We're about done here.  Fine job.
Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
Whoo-hoo! 
Doc-...
And I changed the schedule.
Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
...-ple.
Mm-hm.
Hm.  The wind's northwest.  That oughta be...Seattle.
...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...
Besides, how are we gonna sell something we don't have?
 Move.  This is already affecting our schedule.
Dennis, radio the bikes.  I wanna know if so much as a squirrel...
You have no idea what you're in possession of, do you?
Carl, establish contact with that deputy we met earlier.  He'll be more useful now.
Vaughn.
I wanna patch in from...
This river ends at a hydro dam...
Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?
...gear?




I would've in another life.

 Two pots of coffee...
...somehow. 
Ah.
It's not over, Brynner.

Is Elvis out?
...-five.
A man named Tim Ma-...
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.
My secret?
...is a perfect hunter.
...without caution...
Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...
...fishin'.
And what if it does?
...-m-means, Mason.  
And only then does our noble friend realize...
 I don't know.  Um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe...another hour?
Dr.  Long!
What?  Say again, Ma-...
Where are you now...
Mason, what is the temperature of Elvis?!
If you're not out of there soon, I have got to seal the...
Mason.  Mason!
...side!
 Wait.  Listen to me, Pappas.  If you don't let us by...
...tunnel now!

 Talk to me.
 We've gotta take out Brynner's van before  they reach...
I'll stay here and secure this position.
Negative.  Negative.
 There's ammo fire from Brynner's vehicle.
An honest living.
Then these are all new owners?
Always?
Oh yes.
Very.
None.
...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection. I let 'em practice up out here.
Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized.
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
Where is she?
I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross.
...the coroner's report showed Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.
She's just no good.
You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.
What kind of guy do you think I am?
Sure thing.
How much do you owe me, Curly?
Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
I'll throw that in too.
Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. Then if I don't show, take her down to the boat.
You've done well by yourself.
Looking for someone.
You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
No, he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people. But they weren't very important, just a bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a dam. Now beat it, Gittes, you don't come out of this smelling like a rose, you know.
What are you doing here?
You really think I'm stupid, don't you, Gittes?
Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
It's too late.
I know what he says.
It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. Could he swim?
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
I can't tell you.
Yes... why?
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?
Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
That dam is a con job.
In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
Boy oh boy, you're a mess.
What about it?
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
What does it look like?
I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?
Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. It was an accident, but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no?
That's good. Now what's her name?
I said the truth!
Where'd he go yesterday?
Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
There's just one question.
Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.
I said, the northwest valley.
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
When it comes.
Yeah.
It's bone dry, Morty.
Gittes?... Gittes?
Ida Sessions wants to see you.
Then go home and forget about it.
This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. It takes time.
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.
Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing?
No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer.
Tell me, how many people a week do you foreclose on?
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
You must not come here! How many times do I have to tell you?  If the film catches fire, runt that you are, you'd go up in a burst of flame...whoosh! And turn into a piece of...
'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here.  Besides, there are more kisses than you can count.
Alfredo, did you know my father?
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
It's got to be sent to another town. And if we don't the owner of that movie house gets pissed off.
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
I told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult.
Thanks for all you've done for me.
But Alfredo, what you're saying is horrifying!
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 
No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father.
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
You're still beautiful...
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
No, Salvatore...there is no future. There's only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream.  We never did it when we were kids, remember?  Now that it's happened, I don't think there could have been a better ending. 
I don't remember him any moreMa, where's Russia?
Then where's the money?
See how pretty the house is? We did everything over.  If it hadn't been for you!  Come, I have a surprise....  You must be tired. If you want to rest, there's time before the funeral.
Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -
That's all right.  We have no secrets from our readers.  Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein.  He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?
"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur -  - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -"  I can't pronounce that name, Mr. Kane.
Let's hope they like it there.
You know how long it took the "Chronicle" to get that staff together?  Twenty years.
So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh?  Especially the new papers -
I might make him nervous.
He's a great guy - Leland.  Why'd he ever leave New York?
Who's a busy man?  Me?  I'm Chairman of the Board.  I got nothing but time ...  What do you want to know?
From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end.  Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
You're pretty young, Mr. -  Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me.  One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in -  - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off.  A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.  See what I mean?  Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.
Who else you been to see?
Susie?  I called her myself the day after he died.  I thought maybe somebody ought to...  She couldn't even come to the 'phone.
It ended -  Then there was Susie - that ended, too.  I guess he didn't make her very happy -  You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about -
I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein.  You people work too fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!
Well, he'll be coming back in September. The Majestic.  I got the reservations. It gets in on the ninth.
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
Where is it - where's my notice? I've got to finish it!
Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the "Enquirer." I am Herbert Carter.
You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?
I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story.  You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
Get out, both of you!
You're very easily amused.
Thanks.
Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six -  I run a couple of newspapers.  How about you?
That's a ripe old age -  What do you do?
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I couldn't go threw with singing again. You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you.  That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you.  Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... They don't want you.  They just 0
I mean in New York.
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
You're talking an incredible amount of nonsense, Susan.  Whatever I do -  I do - because I love you.
Let's not start all over again, Charlie.  We've said everything that can be said.
Anything you say, Mr. Kane.  Only we're talking now about what you are.  That's what the note is about, Mrs. Kane.  Now I'm going to lay all my cards on the table.  I'm fighting for my life.  Not just my political life.  My life.  If your husband is elected governor -
You do anything you want to do. The people of this state can decide which one of us to trust.  If you want to know, they've already decided. The election Tuesday'll be only -
You goin', Mom?
Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything I've been saying in the Enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true?
Raymond - 
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Tired?
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
Take dictation -  Front page editorial -  "This afternoon a great man was assassinated.  He was the President of the United States -"
Yes?
Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket?
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.
I'd like to talk to you about that.
First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer."
Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't agree anymore.  I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.
Emily's going south next week with the child.  As far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday.  When they get back -
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
Sorry, Mr. Leland.
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
Yeah, all in crates.
Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.
Or Rosebud?  How about it, Jerry?
Yes, and maybe he didn't.
Who told you you could sit down here?
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.
Yeah, but not in here.
You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
God, isn't he great?
He was?
I was here the whole time.
The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
Was I right?
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
I'm serious.
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin!
With this guy locked in?
Well he asked me for it!
Are you open?
I saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird. Crazy shit.
Cute cat. What's his name.
You open?
What am I worried about?  He'll probably be glad I started the ball rolling. All he ever did was complain about her anyway. I'm just looking out for his best interests.  I mean, that's what a friend does, am I right? I did him a favor.
Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.
Shit!
That's what I said.
I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.  Is the Pelican flying?
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
Eight and a half.
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
Do you know that article is accurate? Caitlin's really getting married!
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
Empire.
It would stand to reason, yes.
Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said...
Perfect dozen.
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
The milkmaids.
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
Vermont?
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
Because you buckled.
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
Julie Dwyer died.
Jesus.
I haven't seen her in almost two years.
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
You hate people.
You were saying?
Shut the hell up.
Oh, my god.
He made it, hunhh?
I could never reach.
I know it was a bad idea to close the store.
We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.
You know what? I don't think I care for your rationale.
So your argument is that title dictates behavior?
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
I didn't think they even enforced this.
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
What happened to title dictates behavior?
There's no lights back there.
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
What? What's with you? You haven't said anything for like twenty minutes. What the hell is your problem?
This life?
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
Am I right or what?
What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
Make them change.
How do you figure?
Like ten after.
It's not like I'm miles away.
Do you work tomorrow?
I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
I'll call you. Let you know.
Get the fuck outta here already.
Do I know you?
I still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room.
I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape.
Oh for God's sake!
Did you say Caitlin Bree?
Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
What? When? When did all this shit happen?
Pay the good man.  Don't you close soon?
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
I work, just like you. You're more of a crook than I am, dude.
I don't know dude. That Caitlin chick's nice. But I see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. She brings you food, she rubs your back... Didn't I see her change your tire one day?
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller!
Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work.  I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch.  You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too.
Oh... Can I help you?
Yeah, but...
You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there.
I said go ahead.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
What? What is that?
How much money did you leave up there?
Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
I was kidding.
"Be there?"
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
You've slept with twelve different girls?
What the hell was that for?
I feel sick.
What is it?
Really?  You're the best.
And that made you feel better?
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
What the fuck did you do that for?
What're you talking about?
Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!  I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.
Maybe we should soap your hand or something.
Thanks. I thought I was gonna have to go to the hospital.
Excuse me, but have you been here all day?
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
That doesn't sound metal.
What part of Russia?
It's probably from being around all this food every day.
To an Asian design major.
Oh my God! You're Rick Derris?
You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
You hope what feels good?
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
Dental School.
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
Like hell you are!
Willam!
Jessie, Hal, come in...please report.  Over.
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece.
Surprise me.
Go on, fetch.
Tucker?
Copy.  Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
Forget me.  If you can, get away.
How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?
What are we going to do?
Sarah, tonight why don't you and Hal come over for dinner?
Do you see them yet?
That's a virtue isn't it?
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
Listen to you...  The old "mouth-to-mouth" resuscitation routine, huh?
You come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave...  This was <u>our</u> home, now it's <u>my</u> home.  I can't leave.  You can stay with me, and believe me, I want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, I can't do it.  And you shouldn't either.
If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.
What if he can't?
I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore, but walk away and you are responsible.  Please Gabe, he went up the west ridge.  If you go up the south face, you can catch him, no problem--
Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?
You still wear the cable necklace I gave you.
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
A simple yes or no would have done.
They'll kill him!  He has no idea!
Frank!  No, Frank!  Frank!
Thanks for holding on.
Crockett River is where the last of the money fell.
The "old mouth to mouth" resuscitation routine.
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
Souvenirs?  No, wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?
You said there was a way across.
He never hurt anybody.
Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it.
You and Frank get the tents, thermal clothing, and medical supplies together.
You gotta be kidding me!  Do you want me to fly up after you? Over.
Where's the third one, Travers?
Get off my back, Qualen!
I don't trust him.
He's alive!
Why the hell are we wasting time here?!
What's the code, Travers?
Rich...
I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.
Yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you I'll meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. It stands to reason, I won't have it.
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, if it isn't little Alex. Long time no viddy, droog. How goes? Surprised are you?
Been punished, yeah?
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!
And now you, another victim of the modern age. But you can be helped. I phoned some friends while you were having a bath.
They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
But, missus, this is an emergency. It's a matter of life and death. Me friend's lying in the middle of the road bleeding to death.
Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
Naughty, naughty, naughty, you filthy old soomaka.
So this is the young man?
Much better, thank you, sir.
What would you like to know, sir?
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.
Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself. Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead. Alex laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes.
I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
And what will you do with the big, big, money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it.
Not tonight - not this nochy.
Who said that?
Yes, sir, and a very lovely place it is too, sir, when I wake up in the middle of the night with my pain.
Well, still the same old place then, eh?
No thanks, Mum. It'll pass in a minute...  ... What have you done with all my own personal things?
Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.
I'm gonna be sick.
Let me get up.
Brown hair, is it?
Have you ever had any mental illness?
Do you wear any false teeth or false limbs?
You're absolutely right, sir.
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
Something like that.
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.
Are you referring to the background score?
You've heard Beethoven before?
How are you feeling today?
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
Good. What do you want?
Very soon now the drug will cause the subject to experience a death- like paralysis together with deep feelings of terror and helplessness. One of our earlier test subjects described it as being like death, a sense of stifling and drowning, and it is during this period we have found the subject will make his most rewarding associations between his catastrophic experience and environment and the violence he sees. Alex retching violently and struggling against his strait jacket.
Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
Can you spare me some cutter, me brother? Can you spare some cutter, me brother? Alex, without looking at him, reaches in his pocket and gives him some money.
Father, I have tried, have I not?
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.
One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!
Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright?
How many to a cell?
The ride is free.
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
Sure.  I'm starting an 800 hotline.  Caught part of your phone call.  And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega...
You need a vacation.
Max, the cab driver!
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
Did you say <u>Dmitri?</u> How do you know about my case?  I don't understand...
...he's two floors below you.
You still carrying passengers?
Come on, it's been a long, shitty day. How about a break?  I'll call a tow truck myself, I swear.  I won't budge from this spot.
...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place.  Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point.  Being around the music, that was the thing.  And I was.  Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in?  Mr. Louis Armstrong.
And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
I know the answer.  I know all there is to know about Louis.
I see.  That was an important list, wouldn't you say?  The people on that list are being subpoenaed tomorrow by a federal judge.  And you "lost" it?
What?
You think I wanted to come here tonight?  You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it.
Captain Walt Muldoon, NYPD.
...if they're wrong?!
I was with Max when he got the call.
Hi, Ma.
I got caught up at work.
I'm standing right here.
He's not paying you one cent!
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit.
Uh, let's go to...  Hello...?
Twenty-four?  Not twenty-five?  Or twenty-three?
Mind if I time you?  What do I get if you're wrong?  A free ride?
Like what?
I think he's dead.
You - you killed him?
Good.  Help me out here.
Get rid of 'em.
Who's that?
But, hey, some good news.  This last one put me way ahead of schedule. We've actually got some time to kill.  Jazz?  You like jazz?
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
Let him go, Vincent.
Show up for what?
Mom, Vincent's not interested.
What the fuck was <u>that?</u>
Limos, huh?
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
I killed him.  When I was 15.  He was my first.  Nah, wishful thinking.  Liver cancer.
What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
Our friends in Little Russia.  Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri.
The man who hired me for this contract.
Washington and Holt.  Dance club called "Fever." Know it?
Your lady friend.  The one who gave you her business card.  Think she was just being polite?
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
And you believe me...?
'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves...
Slow the hell down!
Well.  That was brilliant.
You going to warn him?
I bit the bastard's nose off.
Just relax.
Lucky guess... Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.
Flat, wraparound headlights?
Yes.
See?  Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans?
Nothing scary there.  Sorry.
More about life on Mars.  From a rock they <u>found</u> on the South Pole. Explain that one to me.  But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?
That's it?
So I'm a little jumpy.  Who wouldn't be?
You okay?
You want something to drink?
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
Was that who I thought it was?
You gave me an hour; now give me a day.
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
Did you see the van back there?
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
Oh, Christ, here it comes.  Look, I know you think I'm crazy.  I don't think I am, but...
What about them?
Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
At a horse show.
Love at first sight?
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
Get in.  I'll pull you up to the fourth floor.
I love you, too.
Liza Sutton is dead.
Thank you.
I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?
Can I ask you something?
And you feel bad for it?
So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the President?
If you're as impressed to see me as I am to see you, you're very impressed indeed.  How's Jerry feeling this morning?
Years ago, I worked for the C.I.A. in the M.K. ULTRA program.  Are you familiar with it?
Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
I'm still listening.
Where'd you get it?
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre.
While we walk.  D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies.  No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for.
Agent Lowry.
Jonas?
I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile.
No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
There's no plug to pull.
... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?
Now I remember why I went into theoretical work.  Kent.
Nothing.  Okay.  Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but...
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
Pepsi?  Tequila?
I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator.  We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention.
David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request...
... Two years is still a hell of a long time -- and as far as we can tell there aren't any provisions in the machine design for storing food, water, even air...
Right.  Well.
Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...
Dr. Cullers?
I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
-- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
Pardon me, but you can't do -- !
There is no direct evidence, no.
So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Talk to him.
Could we hear God?
You're not real.  None of this is.
Can you show me?
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
No!  I mean... why so soon?
No more stalling, Captain.
Not if you think like a Vegan.
Greenbank?
But what about your research -- ?
But the work --
Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.
Ellie.
Peter... What is going on?  Has everyone gone completely insane?
... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith.
Your 'faith' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger, only smaller.
Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
It's too... elegant.  The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
How do you mean?
So.  The final countdown.
What?
What are you so afraid of?
And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
But --
... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer:  Why would they send me back without proof?
I don't know.  If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning...
You have a question, Dr. Arroway?
Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion.  But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.
Boss, I made an arrangement with that man to take his broom.
Buck is a deal.
Hot damn, Drag. Tomorrow's Saturday. Another week almost made.
Yeah, well, Arletta, you done your best. What I done with myself is my problem.
Gotta have kings.
Go hard!
Please! Please!
He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
Here, Captain.
Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.
In the Navy, we used to call guys --
You gotta mind your manners, you actin' like a hillbilly tramp.
Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag.
She looks just like Mrs. Patricia Handy, a married woman... I useta fool with. Man, I kin sniff blondes from a hunnert yards and redheads from a mile and a half.
So then you just call him.
Lemme see it!
A cold drink.
That's my baby.
Whatta you so happy about?
Nuthin'! A handfull of nuthin'!  You stupid mullet-head. He beat you with nuthin'! Just like today when he kept coming back at me.
They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.
Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
Luke. Where you goin?
Do we even get our same bunks back?
Like I always do?
That ole box collapse and fall apart before Luke calls quits.
Man, it's so hot.
Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther.
Back a buck.
You think you've been working hard. This muther'll break your back.
Now look what you did.
It's good medicine.
He can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you.  Did you give him an approval?
You're fired.
Sorry, Luv.  I've got a date.
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
I thought he was lying.
The first two murders.
You don't listen very good.  This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  Or I could see it gets forgotten.
Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...
Hello, Daryll Lee.
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.
There were needle marks.  But no drugs in her blood.
Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?
I just thought it was so -- unprofessional.  Of you both!
Yes.  Dahmer!  And after that...
I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone?  Where is the head? Are you looking for it?  Oh, God, why him?  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him.
Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
Are you always so bold?
Don't let go... I can't breathe... I'll die!
It's a woman shot in a car?
Don't hang up!
You know how to use this?
We don't see too many lady homicide detectives.  You have <u>my</u> respect. Have you discussed the note with Dr. Hudson?
How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
What am I wasting my time with this shit for?
You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.
I heard. Good police work.
Answer it.
She didn't fight back, no hair or skin under her fingernails.  I'm not seeing any bruises or contusions...
We're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the Grateful Dead!  Sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass.
There was no sperm.
Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?
I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted just the bastards dumping them in the harbor.  What's keeping those bums at Immigration?  Nightmare in here...
How'd you get in on the deal?
Inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the Boston Strangler?  This is the fourth, is that correct?
We were together six years, sir!
She knows I'm Catholic!  She never mentioned divorce!  Not once!
See, now you've annoyed her.  You know she doesn't like you to touch me.  Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve you so much!  Did you feed her?
She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed her?
Is that a gift from Wendel? It has an aeronautical feel to it.
Where's the car?
What!? They brought the car here?
Have you seen it?
Do you find him attractive?
You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours?
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
So - why the airport?
It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
Patient.
What kind of place is this?
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.
You know what, Ruthie? I better get back to my class, OK?
What about this one?
It'll be fine.
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
You're slowing.
Do we have to talk wedding details?
You did the right thing.
But what am I going to do?
Tell us every detail.
Oh no.
Mom, please.
Oh, Letty, what happened?
I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
Yes.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.
I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will.
Honestly, Letty.
Letty, you should be in bed.
Yeah?
It had this red spot on its back.
Do you mind if I call you Letitia?
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
Let me shift gears here a minute...  Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
A while, I guess.
Don't take it personally.
What are you looking to read?
You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.
No.
We're supposed to be asleep.
Thanks.    Where've you been all day?
What's my rap?
I wish I could have seen that.
It's a good thing my family loves you.
Tell me all.
So there were no problems?
Just checking.
Where to?
Wow.
Not yet.
Who ever said sanity was fun?
Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
You're going to miss the Top Ten.
Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.
What is it? Are you OK?
What?
What do you mean not taking your meds?
I've been thinking I could try to visit you at night after work, and then there'd be more time on weekends to see...
Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach.
I guess I should go now.
So, another one bites the dust.
Can I put these here for tonight?
Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
Yeah.
You know what I think we need? Martinis. How about martinis to celebrate?
Yes, I suppose so.
Exactly. It's time to make decisions.
So will you?
You what?
It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
Getting back.
What?
Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
How's it look?
No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
No.
This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.
Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
Can I offer you something.    A drink? Coffee?
You told me that on the phone. What the hell are you doing here? Showing off your communication skills? Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table.
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
They knew who you were when they broke in your house?
Tonight?
I don't know.
Why not just steal another one?
Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
Turn on the flashlight.
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
That moron.
Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito?
We still have to get out of here.
After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
Yeah?
Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was just watching the news and--
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
I just thought that--
Hey boss, it's not a science.
Just find them!
But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.
And the other car?
Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
What hotel?
There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom.
I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
I knew I should have driven.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
You lived there. You know the city.
We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe --  Do you know who that is?
Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
It's good.
Give it to me, Sami.
Mr. Zammito?
I am Raymond.     Thank you for allowing us to stay here.
Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
He speaks about himself in the third person?
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
J&amp;B?
I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
Can't sleep?
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
Frankie, I --
So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
Who are you?
I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
You're home late... or should I say early?
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
Put them down.
I'll socialize with whomever I please.
Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
You, sister...
They forced me to marry!
Give it back!
Never!
The antidote exists.  She taught it to me.  The formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare.  Trust me. As you have helped me, let me help you.
When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars.  I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan.  I used to look for stars alone.  I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them.  I've been riding in the desert ever since.
Your father's men are still looking for you.  They're still out there, circling closer.
Go.
Mu Bai...It's been too long.
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
I admit, getting it back makes me realize how much I'd missed it.
True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
You think Jade Fox will show up?
Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble.
We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in.
I'll look around and catch up later.
What happened?
Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some hope...
Save your strength.
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.  She's being so considerate.
We know who stole the missing item. If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further.
Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.  Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.  But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead.
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
You buying?
Speak up.  Clear it with the Captain if you need a file.
Could be.
Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the street here."  He will "erase my ass."
You okay, man?  I mean, what just happened.
My name.
I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...
You're welcome.
Don't interfere.
Do you feel okay.
You gotta go now, I bet.
Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
What's goin' on, Elly?
Well, how's your friend?
I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.
Little early from trick-or-treat, homie.  This dick trying to bushwack me.
Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
Miss her?
Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
Blow yourself, bigmouth.
...necklace... pearls...
Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.
An unexpected pleasure.
Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
Are you okay?
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
You heard me.
I have his journal.
He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before.
No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?
I read your teen beat manifesto.
How do you know I've been with several women?
Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?
Romantic? He rapes her.
You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?
I'm busy.
Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.
Need any company?
It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.
Lighten up.
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
You really want to know?
Please don't go.
Hi.
It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.
Why aren't you understanding?
What was that?
I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum.
See that wasn't so bad.
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
Did you hide the letters?
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
Cecile, you have to tell me.
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
If that's what you call it.
What do I do then?
It's like a secret society.
My father just took me on a trip to Australia.
Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.
And then I can go home?
What are you doing?
Want to join me?
Want a blow job?
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
My daughter, Rachel.
He told me he loved me and I believed him.
Positive.
Yes!
McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
Yeah?
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
You would not believe what--
What's wrong with you?
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems.
Tell me all the details.
No, tell me.
Some other time.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
I thought we should celebrate.
Ronald?
In any event, you still owe me my reward.
I can't thank you enough.
Let me get that for you.
Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.
First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.
What do you want?
She's not here.
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
I'll do that.
Right after we played backgammon.
Did she show up?
Hey Ronald.
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
I love the smell of pine.
Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.
It's perfectly normal for a child to dream. I can see how a sensitive little girl, finding this portrait, would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend. That image dwells only in her imagination, and that image can go as quickly as it was born.
What song, dear?
Did your wishes ever come true?
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
All I have to do is look at Amy's eyes, blue and deep like yours.
Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
Where is everybody?
All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
But I told her to go with you.
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
Is that my birthday cake? May I see?
Amy, you remember the party invitations Edward, gave you to mail?
No, I didn't.
I'm sorry. Daddy and Mommy are a little upset.
She's there, just like I said she'd be.
Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden.
Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me.
Daddy?
I've wanted a friend.
All right, Amy.  Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
Merry Christmas, Irena.  I brought you a present.
Merry Christmas.
So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
A lady threw it to me.
A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
I wasn't singing to myself.
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me  always!
The Headless Horseman --
He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren. He'll let me stay.
What?
I hate the storm. I hate it!
Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?
If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
Good night, mother, good night.
You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.
No.
A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
How's the rest of your health?
PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.
Translation: a total geek.
Or if there's a full moon.
You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
Where?
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
And then?
At least your PMS is over.
I wonder if he's married.
Holy shit, I don't know.
What the fuck are we going to do?
I think I just got my period.
This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. "The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love."
Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.
You're kidding, really?
I'm really tired.
What, you got a date or somethin'?
You look different. I mean you look good.
Frida, you know you're it for me.
Coffee and...
Mr. Grant. Did you read that script I was talking about?
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
You busted me.
I'm a cop -- I notice everything. That drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when I left...
Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.
You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
Is that how you feel?
Your breasts feel larger.
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
If you don't like me, just say so. You don't have to make up some bullshit like you're a werewolf.
Be careful!
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
He was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
You can't believe this bullshit.
Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
How the hell is that your business?
You want her sheets?
You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.
Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.
You think mafia hit?
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
What are you talking about?
What kind of animal?
Mnunn.  Cold lately.  That night, couple weeks ago.  That was <u>real</u> cold.  Remember that?
I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
You wont regret this, sir.
How can I submit this?
Where do you think this goes?
Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now.
But...  How long has this been happening?
Look!  This is a good one!
Where does it lead?
Someones after me.
I see.  Then who is after you?  What sins have you committed?
You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?
Water?
What does she say?  The woman.
Your name is John White.
I cannot say...  You don't know the answer to that?
If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
Why?
What is it?
How do you know I'm innocent?
They barely talk anymore.
Now, remember -- keep it simple.
Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love...
I'm not certain about...
Mr. President...
The Washington Post.
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
You're fired.
Till what?
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
Clean.
What about the wife?
Uh, let me get back to you...
When does it break?
What's with the cameras?
He's not a President! He's an ordinary person.  I can kill an ordinary person.
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
Was he a senator? Is he on the Trilateral Commission? Was he in Who's Who In Washington NINE YEARS Reed wrestles him away from the door, as Bob struggles to get free.  I'll destroy him, Alan. I'll shred the bastard!!!
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
No.
You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...
Well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
Dave...
Dave!
I thought you said I wasn't going to see her.
Now he's making stuff up about me.
Mr. President, may I speak frankly with you?
You ever think back to how you started.
One day my wife says to me 'Why don't you try running for office.  You talk about it all the time, why don't you just do it?'  So I tell my boss I have a dentist appointment and I go down to the registrar of voters on my lunch break.  Next thing I know, I'm a councilman.
How'd you get started?
You're not?
Really?
So you just protect the President the whole time?   That's your whole job?
You ever use it?
But Bill was your king, not Bob.
Didn't mean to bum you out.
Well...
I would have taken a bullet for I you, Dave.
... You know, if you want to be the same old bastard, that's fine.  I can handle it.   But don't pull this 'man of the people' bullshit and then do something like this.
Look.  If there was some mistake...
Oh... Yeah.
Where are you going?
Where's home?
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
I lock at you and I see Bill...  I mean, he's almost dead, but he's right here... I mean, you're right here... alive and...
You know, secretaries and stiff.
It was okay?
Well I guess...
What's wrong?
Yeah.   He's a good man.
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
It could be fun.
I wish I had better news... Our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that's down eighteen on the year.  The `Cares About People Like Me' numbers are really in the toilet.  We're off twenty points from March and that was right after we raised interest rates...
Please...senor...destroy me...one bullet...please.
His madness....could be from shock.
What is it?
What is it?
I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!
Well, Miss Henried, what a coincidence. You're just in time fer a case that seems ta concern you. Guess you didn't care about the other proceedin's we been dealin' with here this mornin'.
There's no place like this place. Warm climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the Feds knew that. That's why they stored so much o' their shit down here. It's all mine now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come after us down here, which they will some day...take a likin' ta what all we got an' come after us. They'll hafta get past my army! An army that ain't afraid ta die...ha ha ha...'cause it's awreddy DAID! HA HA HA HA....
The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth.
Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...
Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes.
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
There ya go. Complete with air canisters...little motors.
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.
I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse.
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
You can't run away from the planet, Miss Science. You can't even run away from the island, heh heh.
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
Mary.
It's been fired.
What'dya get?
No relation.  Never heard of him. Sorry.
You know how many demerits we're talking?
I feel like I've never been alive.  For years I've been risking nothing.  I have no idea what I am or what I want to do! Neil, you know you want to act.  Knox wants Chris.
What do you mean you don't know?
Well, welcome to "Hell"ton.
Oh God, it's over now!
But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?!  What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
Nuwanda?  Please?
Welton Academy, hello?  Yes, he is, just a moment.  Mr. Nolan, it's for you.
Hey, I heard you went to summer school?
Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.  I'm just saying
Maybe he'll have some advice.  Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,
Pleased to meet you.
But I love you.
Of course I know you!  From the first time I saw you, I knew you had a wonderful soul.
Of course just like that.  That's how you always know when it's right.
Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.
Uh-huh.
God, if Chet found out he'd...
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
Yes sir.
Very good, Mr._?
And don't limit poetry to the word. Poetry can be found in a work of art, music, a photograph, in the way a meal is prepared--anything with the stuff of revelation in it.  It can exist in the most everyday things but it must never, never be ordinary  By all means, write about the sky or a girl's smile but when you do, let your poetry conjure up salvation day, doomsday, any day, I don't care, as long as it enlightens us, thrills us and--if it's inspired--makes us feel a bit immortal.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
LOUDER!
Todd, there's a picture of Whitman over the door.  What does he remind you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't think about it.
Use your imagination!  First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
All right!  What'd she say?
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
Weird.
So what do you think of my father?
What?
What is it then?
I've found it.
Come on, that's impossible.
None of what Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it?
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
Er  No.
Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one.  Maybe they thought...
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
You the Captain?
It's not going to help us!
Nobody's shooting nobody...come on, just let us through the hatch!
And what? These things are octopusses?
No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
We were talking about my schedule...
I'm not staying here!
What other bunch?
Unless you collected on the insurance...
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
Self sufficient...
I don't know where it is!
The "come back" kind.
There's not much horsepower left in the engines, but there's enough noise...once this baby's set...I'll rev it up...that slimy bastard will come for it like candy...
Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...
You don't take orders very well, do you?
Let's just keep going.
The hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable...
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
Here's what I think...I think these mokes below are a hit sqaud.
...Jagger was here...I was here...
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?
Someone's back there.
Hey! What are you trying to pull!
Why don't you help us so we can get done faster so we can get the hell out of here?
What's there to think about?? That THING back there...
She fucked us both.
Fucking women, man...
Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!
Damn right!
It is not!
This is it. Definitely. This is it, but they changed it.
It's gotta be the next one. I mean it's gotta be! Right, Albert?
Where the hell were you? We were all set -- beer, broads. Right? Am I right?
You, Vince! You! You are! You're a crock! You're a walking, talking crock!... I mean, what do you know?
Sure. Why not.
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
Did you ever think life would turn out like this?
I have to go.
No, I --
Yeah... Do you mind if I sit?
No. None of that.
You mean...?
Wait! First I give you special fuck!
How was huntin'?
Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em!
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
Linda...
I was just wondering... Nick... You're going hunting... If I could use this place to stay, because...
What kind of beer would you like?
How are you?
How's the trailer?
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
Nick?
You're going hunting?
You seem... disturbed.
Who the hell is he?
You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this.
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell!
I just wait. You know?
You think about it?
So do I.  I want to be ready... You have to be ready... It has to be there, in your mind.
I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo.
Promise! You gotta promise!
It's ahead, by the tree.
I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick.
We gotta play with more bullets.
No way. No fucking way!
I like it, Nick.
Here, here! This is it!
Sure I got boots. I got boots right here.
No.
Don't worry what it says in the book.
Great. That's great.
Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.
John Wayne's great... Listen, Sal. Jesus. When are you getting out?
Did you get one?
Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?
Just like always! Just like it always was! Right, Nick? Am I right?
That's him.  Simon Doucet.
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
Yeah?
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
I worked for him... still do.  Said he'd make sure I was left alone if I helped put Wade away.  He kept his promise for twenty years.
I'm not on the force anymore.
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
Mug sheets.
Hello Wade.
You can't kill me.  I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.
What is it?  I'm about to go on.
What do you mean he's escaped?! They're not supposed to escape!
Sir, your limo's here.
Sir---
You sure?  I can help you.
You my partner?
Are you a cop?
You can't turn him off.  He's the Commissioner.
Wanna come?
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
You need anything else?
You want to be a good detective?
Maybe I should turn myself in.
I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
Wanna try?
Wallet, cash, I.D...
You treat her nice.
You okay?
I just heard.
I'm going to be a policeman.
Belle Dee. I'm from over the mountain.
Golly, Belle, that was a good idea -- we should do that every morning.
No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be --  -- a man that eats fire?
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington.
Jabez -- will you join our Grange now?
You're not -- Dorothy.
Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
What's the matter with you?
Where did it come from?
Yes, why shouldn't it?
It's mine?
Excellent. A firm, fair signature. One that will last till doomsday.  My dear Neighbor Stone, I congratulate you! You're going to be the richest man in New Hampshire! 
Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
But you should, now that you are becoming a father.
Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
Well -- Mr. Webster! This is a great day for me. Come on in, sir. I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!
They make plucky women in New England.  H'm ... how long have we to wait?
Why -- good morning, Squire.
Oh!
Worst I had in years -- ahem -- starting a spring cold, I guess -- er -- don't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house, do you, Stone?
And so, Jabez Stone, in the name of the Whig Party of Cross Corners, we offer you the nomination of that party for Selectman.
Why of course --
You keep that -- that's for you. I want you to talk up the party to make sure that the best folks really come.
Yes  siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: "Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor." Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.
To save us work on the spring plowing?
Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end?
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
We must go on home, Jabez.
You'll never change -- will you?
Jabez -- once you said we'd never change --
Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 
But Jabez, I never said that!
Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?
It won't be the first baby ever born in this house.  There! Made me drop a stitch!  Sit down, you make me nervous!  Lan's, that's the way a man always is. Thinks his son's the most important thing in the world.
Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
Do you really think that?
Oh, here you are, Jabez. Lan's, I was worried about you.... Hail in August! The crops will be ruined!
Ma -- is she? --
It seems such an obvious candidature to us all.
Fox hunting -- a Stone going fox hunting on a week day -- and the earth crying out for the touch of him!
What are you looking for, Colonel?  What's your name?
Oh -- Mr. Webster -- I'm so glad you came!
Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
Mr. Webster, I presume?
My congratulations -- as between two gentlemen.
Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?
You're all right, Argyle.
One of yours?
-- ten blocks?  Are you crazy?  It's Christmas Eve, thousands of people -- the Mayor'll scream bloody murder --
What are you going to do?
Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
What am I, a method actor?  Hans, babe, put away the gun.  This is radio, not television...
Hope I'm not interrupting...?
You're amazing.  You figured this all out already?
-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --
It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed models as a boy.  The exactness, the attention to every foreseeable detail... perfection.
I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you?  Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion.
Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...  ...I might get to someone you do care about.
Encourage them to be bolder.
What are you doing?
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
Hey, I love you.  So do a lot of the guys.  So hang in there, man.  Hang in there.
Yeah, just trying to handle some year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What do they put in these things?
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
So whatsa deal?
These seats come out?
I was lookin' at it.  I saw you, man!  Jesus!  You oughta see yourself!  You wouldn't believe it.
God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.'
Hey, don't take the car!
Jenny?
It looks like a whole roast.
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.
How are you doing?
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up.
Yeah...
I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
Who the fuck knows?  I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll go to Algeria.
I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped!
Denmark?  Sweden?
Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
Look... don't throw that on me.
Yeah... yeah!
He's makin' threats in there.
You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
Who's this?
Okay, you're in there and we're out here.  What do we do now?
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name?
Sonny-boy, one word?
Calm down, you're not ...
Okay, what do you give me?
What the hell you doin' back there?
So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
Yeah ...
Don't fuck with me ...
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
Yeah?
I want to talk to him.
Here comes the FBI.  You men lookin' for protection?  We got all the police right here.
Okay, okay... we know it's a stickup!
Okay, is the vault open?
Hello... I'm sorry I can't talk to you right now... I suggest you call during banking hours tomorrow. What is your name?
The gun's right on your back...
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
What?
They're like any others but they're special to me.  You got kids?  You told me; you got two.
You know, I don't know him very well - but he's not gay ... and he's not going back to prison ... One time when he was in prison, they gang-banged him; 13 years old and eight guys gave it to him ... So Sal isn't goin' back to prison, no way.
Mister Mulvaney?
Are you a lawyer?
You all right?
Hey, girls -- I was on television...
I wish somebody would tell me I'm gonna live long enough for it to be a habit.  My parent, she'll be okay. My husband, he'll be okay.  I even know who the bum is gonna marry. Terrific.  She'll take good care of him.
Ah, Sonny!  Good luck, you know?
When was the last time you saw Sal?
Because I don't want cancer.
He's gone?
He wants one.
I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...

I never been up in a plane before.
Okay ... okay ... all right, Sal, it's okay.  I got everything straightened out ... it's gonna be okay.
Hey, Sal ... How you doin'?
Bullshit!
Okay - you got your one.
Okay, who's the head teller here?
Oh, shit!  I gotta have time to think.
Hey, let's get ready!
Here's your document, Sonny.
I can't, Mom.  If I come out Sal will kill them.
What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?
Why are you doing this?
But I mean, why do you need to steal?  Couldn't you get a job?
The audience is interested in you, Sonny ... not me.
You're news, Sonny ...
And if you can't deliver them?
<i>They can do subtitles.</i>
Fella takes out two kids and has the audacity to not show up for trial.
So what?
Why the hell are we delivering them out here? I can't even find any warrants in the system for these four.
<i>The FBI was breathing down Lateesha's neck... and she assumed that they were onto our scam. So she set up some college kids to take the fall for the heist. They have been under FBI surveillance for the past 6 months.</i> <b> INT. CHEVY SUBURBAN </b> Claremont drives like a maniac.
You're breaking up... I can't hear you.
Where are you? <b> INT. CHEVY SUBURBAN -- NEXT </b> Claremont is behind the Wheel of a BLACK CHEVY SUBURBAN. He pulls into the Texaco parking lot.

What do you mean? Claremont didn't provide them?
Many times.
We didn't sign on for this shit.  Fuck! This shit is intense. I need to call my agent.
We're covered on legal with that, right?
Ain't nobody gonna call me a bitch without some payback.
Just like Billy Ocean says. <i>When the going gets tough...</i>
Meeka's white blood cell count is dropping fast.
You don't like Public Enemy?  It's the dope shit.

You almost knocked me down.  The word is "excuse me."
That's not even true.  I just want a slice.
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
What da fuck!  Are you deaf?
Buggin' Out, I gotta work here.
You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker. Where did you read that?
As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted by the finest.
The evil eye doesn't work on me.
Mookie.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Do me a favor.  Go to work.
Jade.
I'll see you out.
That's why I don't fool with it. Only let you touch it...Ouch!
Number One: I got some jive, late- rent-paying trifling Negroes in this house.  Every year I keep threatening to sell it.
Sweet Dick Willie.
Let it be broke.
I didn't say nobody, I said you.
ML stands for ML.  That's it.
Korea man is OK.  Let's leave him alone.
Mookie, what took you so long?  I got a business to run.
Mookie, get offa da phone.
Sal, just do me a favor, leave Jade alone.
Yeah, do you know 'em?
Do we now?
How much?  How much do I owe you?
No.  What are you gonna do?
Yeah!...I'm goin' to the beach for the first day in fifteen years. Gonna take the day off and go to the beach.
Tina, what do you want me to do?
Hot.  Hot.
Later for you.
I know this.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
Sal's Famous Pizzeria, yeah, two large pizzas, pepperoni and anchovies, hold on...  See, Pop, Mookie fucking talking on the phone and people are trying to call in orders.  He's making us lose business.
Pop, I think we should sell this place, get outta here while we're still ahead...and alive.
Pop asked you.
How ya doin', Mookie?
Pop, I'm gonna go with Mookie.
Yeah, we're closed. So go away.
Kan maaaaw Roy Orbison kin nah mah oh che.
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald twrip.
Excuse me?
What? Well now I'm in a position where I may just heed your help.
HARRY? Are you okay?
My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
What are you wearing?
Uh... not a great first impression... Dinner's ready.
The name's Walter.
Wow just like Marco Polo.
Then a sleep-over is okay by me. Okay boys, eat up.
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?
Just a guy I hang out with.
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
Whoa. What was that?
Where did you learn that word?
What's with horse-boy, now he's a bright shiny sun?
You're it.
Can he do that?
According to the map, we're just about at school.
How do you know it's for us?
Who's your partner?
That's a cow, Harry.
Hey, where did you come from?
Do you want me to pet your head?
If you have to ask, you don't know.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend!
You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me.
You know Lloyd, the real treasure is our friendship.
Hey Lloyd. This looks like another one of your mix tapes.
What? What did we do?
A float!
Wait, wait!
Guys, this is much better.
The one on the left.
Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
TURK, leave him alone.
Hey, Turk rescued you from the nerd. You're in!
Well I was born in St. Louis.
What are you doing here?
What?
Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.
Oh, baby, you're the bestest.
Well, something stinks.
I'm so close I can feel it.
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
Do I know you?
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
Senior year. My little boy. Who woulda thunk it?  You're a good kid, Lloyd. I don't say it enough, but I'm proud of you son.
Obviously.
Let's go Margie. The museum ain't going to teach itself.
Looking for a scoop, huh? I'll give you a scoop... of short bus.  Lose her!
What?
Left here! Left!
Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do I do if he smells the trap.
I can turn on all the faucets in my house.  Even the hose.
You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.
So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon, Baron, and I have here your answer from Duke Leto.
It was Feyd?  It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet ring?  I must have his ring.
I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
What's that you're saying?
Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... -- The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank.
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.
What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.
Don't you trust your own eyes.
He knows.
What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
Will we see a worm?
Always?
Liet?
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
THE PAIN!
Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation.
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
Uh, beg to differ.
Why were you buying a coffin?
You know, I saw you perform "Dracula."  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  When is your next picture coming out?
Eddie, you got a new movie for me?!
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
How 'bout a western?  People love westerns.
Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!
Sure.  Romance, that's great!  To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures.  Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!
Those bastards at Universal.  I made so much money for them, and now I can't get the time of day.
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
Let me take you to the hospital.
Should I call a doctor?
What's in the needle?
You'll be sitting on the right.
"Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.
But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
Goddamn, it's cold!
Don't you have any savings?
Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
Okay.  But what if I'm not in <u>too</u> big a hurry?  What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life?  To smell a flower?
And, cut...
I've never seen anything like him!
PLACES, EVERYONE!  ROLL CAMERA!
Which one <u>is</u> the red one?
Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970?  How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?
Edward, are you sure you know what you're doing?
We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild.
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are <u>you</u> the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
No!  A horror movie star!
Close!  The <u>other</u> one!
All I wanna do is tell stories.  The things I find interesting...
Goddamn landlord.
That's right...
That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
Pleased to meet you.  I'm Loretta King.
For this one, we need $60,000.
Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.
Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.
I kinda need it now.
Hey big shot, get off your ass.  They need a potted palm over in the Carl Laemmle Building.
Mr. Wood?!
Yeah...?
"Graverobbers From Outer Space"! It's <u>money in the bank</u>.
Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!
And PERFECT.  CUT!
I like to think so.
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
Hey!  You're not eatink.
My friend, you tink Greta is first woman I ever see?  No!  Many duds, before I find her.
What is happening?
Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.
Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
Screw you, Wood!  I even sunk more money into different titles: "Transvestite" "He Or She?" "I Led Two Lives"... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit.
The marriage already ended.
You look beat.
I might as well be.  I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  I blew it.  All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
You know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better!
No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy??
You should feel lucky.  Ed's the only guy in town who doesn't pass judgment on people.
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!
I'm really sorry...
You know, to make the legs move --
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
Please, be compassionate.  I'm your husband!
I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
Her. That look. She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother.
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
You know what would be great?
Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.
Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you?
How you doing, Ed?
Ed, everything goes off. "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off --
Take him off the air.
Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!
Mr. Pekurny.
Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby...  Jessica!
No.
No. It's a mess.
Yes.
She could've been a nurse.
Who?
I'm at the hospital.
St. Joseph's.
What?
Hi. Is Shari here?
What does this mean?
Hey, Lou.
Yeah...
Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
Cream rinse?
So?
Oh my God.
Leave. Go.
What are you doing?
It's really a tremendous turnoff.
I wish my stepfather was here.
Um...
I have no privacy. Even now! I'm crying and I can't stop and they won't go away. And now it's going to be another month!
Everybody hates me!
A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no."  They hate me!
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
Okay.
This is going right up your ass.
Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in.
But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV.  Hah?
Yeah. I service video equipment.
Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
Mr. Pekurny. I'm sorry to bother you. My son would just love to have your autograph.
You don't recognize me.
Quite a shithole, isn't it?
That girl's an idiot.
Um... They gave me a limo, uh...
Are you busy tomorrow night?
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
Mm.
Ohh... do you own a cat?
We don't have foibles.
Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours.
What does that have to do with... ?
By the X.
You're not just jealous, are you?  I mean, we both used to talk about her
Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time.
Larry?
He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more.
It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
Well, good luck there, Tracy
Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body.  And so far she was running unopposed.
Here they are.
Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
Thanks for everything.
I can't wait to start campaigning.
Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
Tim Kobza?  Tim Kobza!  Who's he? I've never heard of him!
I guess you know why you're here
I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
Yes?
I told you!  I told you!  You're going to pay for my banner!
Handles pretty good, don't you think?
So Tracy?
I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college.
Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer.
Exactly when?
Which door?
points at the motel.
Shall we give it a name?
Yep.
Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident.
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
And she's super-nice
Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy.
You said I was a liar   You're the liar, you're the --
What?
People can see this.
We still have some extra ones, don't we?  Maybe we can just --
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
Can I sign yours too?
Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
You say 'fuck' a lot.
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
So you saved her.
Did you talk to Exley?
I want to know about Exley.
In the morning.
Captain, what do you want?
He helped me out once.  That's all.
Him and me both.  <u>Fucking Exley</u>.
They're yours.  Take them.
How what, Wendell?
You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.  You're not your old, cruel self anymore.  I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp.
You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about.
Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good.
Maybe.  I don't know.
Yeah, that's Stens.
Dudley.
Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.
You wanted to meet here?
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
No.
That's right.
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
Should I?
How 'bout I give you your balls back?
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
What do you mean?
Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33.
Jack Vincennes.  He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir.  He lives for it. That's the way to get him.
Anything?
Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell.
That was his favorite toast.  I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  You placed first out of twenty-three.
Dudley, we've been over this.
No.
Yes, I do, sir.
Why?
Something like that.
Glasses.
Damnit... <u>What</u>?
What's that for?
What are you going to do?
For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
How was I?
I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff?
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
My daughter was a virgin!
<u>Hush-Hush</u>.  Off the record and on the Q.T.
No.  But I've got something going with Ad Vice.
Not a word.
You're back, boychick.
Shut up!
Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.
Someone else?
209 to anyone! I need some help here!
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
Zavitz, what? You want your old job back?
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
Tell us about Rachel Banks.
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
That's who they are.
I don't know what that means.
I don't know what that means.
What if I find out what they're after. You know these people, I don't.
How many years have <u>you</u> been hiding from them? How many years have you been running?  What'd they do to you?
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
What'd I tell you?
I intercepted phone calls.
Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
Gimme that.
Fuckin-A.
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
Listen to you, "directly". You're not gonna get <u>near</u> the News Department. And if you did, it'd never get on the air. Time-Life buried the Zapruder film for 15 years.
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
What if <u>what</u>?
Reynolds.
You wanna get caught spying on Albert?
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
Is it okay?
Very good.
It's a little late for that.
I know, but--
Yes?
Witnesses said you were there, but I notice you didn't file a report.
Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something.
About the accident.
For your wife?
I don't know what's goin' on with Zavitz, but that was way, <u>way</u> outa line.  You understand?
Bobby!
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
I'm sorry.
Bobby?
You <u>swore</u>!
I think you should leave now, Robert.
I <u>told</u> you they could do this. I <u>told</u> you they had this kind of capability and that with this anti- terrorism it would be just another--
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
They're saying you killed that policeman.
It's really over?
My suitcase--
What can I do for you?
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
How's the trout?
Here's what you asked for. Brill's note said it was everything you'd need to, shall we say, coax DePinto--
Never.
Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission.
I gotta go.
I'm gonna fix it.
You're wrong.
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
Hey!
Robert--
Gentlemen--
Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth.
Sure, go ahead.
It's okay to use the phone.
They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.
What?
He's heard that it's escalated.
They killed Rachel.
You gotta--
I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
Turn yourself in.
It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
Tell me about it.
"I know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars". Revelations II.
What about the tapes?
I sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history. Why can't I bring in a man whose name <i>is in the</i> <i><u>fucking</i></u> <i><u>phonebook</i></u>?!
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.
We're not stupid, Reynolds.
No thank you.
I can't sing.  but I can tell a story.  I might need a prompt.  Do you have your Herodotus?  I've noticed you carry it
Which stall?
That insults them.
Why did you follow me yesterday?
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
What's this?
This is not very good, is it?
Geoffrey's not in Cairo.  He's not actually a buffoon.  And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government.  They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
I'm impressed you can sew.
Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!
I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
Why did you hold his collar?
I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there?  How can you ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?
It hurts too much.
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love.  Excessive love of one's wife.
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
Oops!  Mustn't say International. Dirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty! Die Fhrer!  Il Duce.
Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?
Do you have your papers, sir?
I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ -
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
What did you do?
I was talking about the girl.
Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me.  My wife is dying.
No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples.  You'll find a girl there.
David Caravaggio.
Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.
Why is there so much nose?  I can't hear myself think!  Look - give me something.  So we can all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.  It's too hot.
They're fresh.  I haven't eaten an egg inhave you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?
I could help you.  I could get you off that.
What do you do?  What are you doing here?
Hana?  Hana?  Are you alright?
Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
Is it you?  If I said Moose I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?
First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
Thought you'd never wake up!
Have a drink.
What?  You and Madox?  Or you and Katharine Clifton?
Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.
What did you say?
You get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it? Black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog. I thought I would kill you.  You killed my friends, you ruined my hands.  But the girl was always here, like some Guardian Angel.
I was just saying, I'm going to cable Downing Street, see if I can't stir up a few shillings - Katharine's mother and the PM's wife are best -
Oh.
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
Of course.  Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
Oh - I've found plums.  We have plums in the orchard.  We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
There's a man downstairs.  He brought us eggs.  He might stay.
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him.  He's Indian, he wears a turban.
With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
You like him, don't you?  Your voice changes.
For my hair?
So I follow the wires?
No. But he hands them over.
If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
Why Picton?
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever you and Lieutenant Singh
You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
You've got a mustache.
Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us.  We're not accustomed to the company of women.
Darling, Peter says I could stay
How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
What about your rank or serial number?
Am I being interrogated?  You should be trying to trick me.  Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur.  Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted.  Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way.
You didn't answer the beeper either.
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?
We've got to catch him in the act.
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
You don't call, you don't write.
In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
I have a question...
A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
How about if I try humility.
You have a car?
I didn't expect you to be so...
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
Oh?
I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake.
A film case.
Motorcycle.
What about your bags?
I don't believe this.
What's my problem? You want a list?
And good morning.
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
I'll need that.
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
Why don't we take oxygen?
So how long to pop the floor?
Thank you.
Won't take any time.
Camera in the--
One, two, three...
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.
Okay, you're a thief.
The big job.
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
The Mask. Where is it?
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
Got it.
There's always a surprise.
Access codes to the vault are changed daily, passwords for our computer on the hour...
Four billion dollars.
The sign of our partnership.
Jesus God, it's going through.
Don't panic, now, there's no rush...
The door's the only way out!
Come on.
Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.
You have the right to remain silent. But anything you say may be taken down in evidence and used against you--
He looks familiar.
A true master. Classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think?
Always in a rush.
I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports.
I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?
Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
Oh, it is.
It's too soon.
So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.
See you.
Anna?  With this real-estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me, cause I'm a little confused about how exactly we do that.
Tell you what, why don't you go on over to reception, tell them I said Mario should take you to the airport.
Whoa.  Remind me.
What the hell is this doing here?
What?  Hey -- <u>he</u> hit <u>me</u>.
Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis?
This is a real nice place you got here.
Thank you.  I think so too.  That's why I'm being such a stickler on this house price thing.  I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's backside, especially after all they've done for Hinkley, but I look around here and I think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it.  And I don't just mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over.
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick --
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
It's a good day.  I feel good.
The judge came up with a number.
They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now.
Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
I'm sorry, Erin.
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
Erin, you've been gone for a week.
What medical records?
Okay.  A 5% raise, and --
I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed that send button -- PG&E claims department is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting.
We can get these people.  With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds.
For your information, Frank cares what was in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half his day wading around them.  That was his job.
Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here.  This is some damn good work.
Oh, they knew.  They had to know.
I was just asking.  Are you all right?
Oh, Jesus.  You wanna tell me what the problem is here, or --
Whoa.  No shit.
So why would PG&E offer it?
When?  Where?
Fuck Kurt.
I was wrong.
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
Two million dollars?
You know what, Erin?  I got nothing but time here.  Why don't you let me do that for you, and you can get your kids some dinner.
What kind of chromium is it?
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
What are you <u>doing</u>?  Where's George?
You've been reading for hours.
Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?
Annabelle Daniels.
Okay, look -- I think we got off on the wrong foot here --
Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.
I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call, George.
Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here?
Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there?
I'm bored, and so are the kids.
Fuck you.  Just cause I don't spend all day trying to prove what hot shit I am --
I know.  But still.  Six months.  I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em.
More than you need me.
No, I need my car --
It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
Where's my paycheck?
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
Well, look, there isn't a ton of information here, but from what there is, I'd say that these two people here -- what are their names?  Shanna and Ashley?
Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on doors.  And you know what?  They're not.  I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water.
I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study.
Yes, My Lord.
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
Will he finish what he begins?
Stopped they must be.  Do you hear?  On this all depends.
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
How you doing, Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?
Howls.
I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
Barks his consternation.
I'm looking for a great warrior.
No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
What is thy bidding, My Master?
Our destruction?  Who?
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
That's right.
Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.
He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie.
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
Not you?
You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...
Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... Han, I don't know how ...
Would it help if I got out and pushed?
Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
We've got to get out of this shower.
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
They're moving away.
Stop that.
What are you afraid of?
There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
I do not!
There's something out there!
Looks like some kind of Mynock.
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.
That depends.  Where are we?
Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs.
You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.
I don't like this.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.
Are you kidding?
Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
Get out of here, Lando!
This ought to be good.
I'll take what's mine now.
Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.
Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
We've got to find Luke.
What'd you say?
You rest now.
First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there?  How's Luke?
Ready are you?  What know you of ready?  I have trained Jedi for 800 years.  My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.
I have followed my feelings.
That they are.
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
What's in there?
Will they die?
Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?
Your future lies with us, Skywalker. Now you will embrace the dark side. Obi-wan knew this to be true.
There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.
Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.
I mean he's of your race. He's an Ape.  Look.  You don't have to be afraid.  We've put him in chains and under sedation. Do you understand that?
ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.
Ooww!
Give it to me.
Give it.
I thought he was, but he came back.
Oh Cuervo...
I need a favor.
Wait a minute. I know that voice.  You're Carjack Malone.
I was called away on urgent business, Snake.
See you in hell, Snake.
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype?
Location.
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
Could be a big one comin' any minute now...
You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help.  You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up.
Who?
I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going.
Where's the anti-toxin...?
The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make you a knight. Rise, Sir...
Fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me.
You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.
But your life and lands are far from here.
These men repented before God for their evil deeds. Those who would not, met their fate at the end of my sword.  Accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift.
They miss the battlefield. I think we do too.
Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?
Who is Merlin?
Whose son am I?
How? Where?
Who will it be? Put your mind to it, then.
The knights of Galys approach the camp. It would be politic...
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights. And by you. Perhaps most of all by you. For you made me, you forged this wretched life. And like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister...
I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin?
But, I'm here.
I will muster a great force of knights, and I will return to fight for what is mine.
Who is, then?
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, rest here.
To me? But why?
There are things about love--
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
No, no, of course not. You are young...
When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.
It's done. A truce. We meet at the river.
Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...
Well why are they tearing the building down?
Well, he does know the background. I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist. There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway.
You're convinced that it's genuine.
I'm sorry.
Here.
Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
What's Burke got to do with it?
Would you like some more coffee?
Oh, she'd love it.
I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times.
Rats?
No. No rats.
Karl? Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
A man to see you.
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
So, what causes this?
Do you keep any drugs in your house?
He didn't mention?
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
Thanks. Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good.
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
No it's alright I'll take it straight.
Is she gonna die?
We'll see when we get home okay.
Hey, where'd this come from?
You know how?
Who's Captain Howdy?
I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
Oh Regan I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy. Burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin' to do.
Oh you did. What did you hear?
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
People get tired.
Karras.
She doesn't remeber a thing.
Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal? The poor box?
Think you can sleep?
Withering Heights.
Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you.
Do it again.
You speak Latin?
Quod nomen mihi est?
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous. He is a liar, the demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us. The attack is psychological , Damien. And powerful. So don't listen, remember that, do not listen.
Save me o' God by thy name, by thy might defend my cause, proud men have risen up against me, men of violence seek my life, but God is my helper, the Lord sustains my life and every need he has delivered to me, glory be to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Save your servant
You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?
And Dennings, you read how he died?
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
No, I mentioned it only in passing.
Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
Who?
Your mother sucks cocks in hell Karras, you faithless slime!
Almighty Lord, word of God the father Jesus Christ, God and Lord of all creation, who gave to your holy apostle the power to tramp underfoot serpents and scorpions. Grant me, your unworthy servant pardon for all my sins...
I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...!
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Yes
Is there someone inside you?
Give me the keys.
Give me the keys.
What're you saying, Charlie?
Twelve years.
Beasley.
What's our friend's problem?
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack.
Oh, look at you two.  So skinny. And those tiny suits ...
What happened to the two Clays, Willie?
What's the gig?
That's not the point.
What's wrong with it?
So we on tomorrow night?
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
What d'ya got?,
It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
What's with Charlie?
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
Jack.
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
The hell you don't.
Sure, why not.
What's that?
Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
I suppose we can bring it down a little.
Get out of here.
All right, all right.  I'm a little tense.
No.
Better take care of your fingers, little brother. Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.'
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
He's drunk.
Unless you want the right.
We might as well do the towels the same way.
All night?
No! I never hear it!  Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
What's the matter with you?
How dare you say you love me.
What the hell are you doing?
Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.  Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?
He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
April.
Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
That takes care of this week.  The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri.
Cancel, Frank.
What's it for?
Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?
What?
Jack!
Go ahead.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?
Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?
You sure?
Your limo's ready, Ma.
But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
Where's your dress?
We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors?  Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ...
Fucking.
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
By the way, I got a messsage yesterday from some guy looking for New Year's action.  Resort, upstate.
You two could play checkers.
Peggy Lee?
What's with you two?
Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack.  So. Susie.  How 'bout it.
Uh ...
Some discussion.
I can't sing it anymore.
Tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos.  We were assured they were in tune.
Is that important?
Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd?
Thanks.
Don't worry about it.
You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker. The doctor doesn't like to be bitten.
It went well tonight.
And you don't?
You miss him, don't you?
Fucking.
The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well, au revoir.
Forget it.
Aren't the kids asleep?
Can't sleep?
It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.
How's egghead?
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
You're upset.
All I said was you were good.
What's that supposed to mean?
You were good.
Nina?
Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
Jack.
Yeah.
Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast.
In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop.  Then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him.
My days are not the old days, genius.
Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?
How'd the show go?
Merry Christmas, Jack.
Big piece or little?
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.  I'm glad you've stayed clean.
Nice-looking kid.
Or reactivated the first one.
... I was dreaming ...
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
Who is this?
What do you mean?
This is it, Jon.  For the next 72 hours -- you're on your own.
You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
You killed them?
Stay away from my family!
We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
Just saving the tax-payers the cost of a trial.  So take a hike.
Clarissa left those here.
You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off!
What happened?
I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.
You'll need to recultivate that virus.
You'd have to start immediately.
The hospital.
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
... That's great.
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
What are you doing?
Remember this from our junior prom?  Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.
Oh, and Oxxford called...
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
No...
Well, Alan, I think were gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
Jack, are you okay?
Mom, dont you think we need to open the presents?
Were almost done here...
They did a pretty good job.
You know how to make chocolate milk?
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
What am I saying?  You dont need to hear that...  All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, thats all.  Is that you?
Damn...
I dont care if youre Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still cant park here.
Got a minute, Jack?
You cant do this. You cant keep coming in and out of peoples lives, messing things up...
Like the dress...?
Mushroom puffs arent the only thing I do well...
Mr. Mintz?  I dont think so...buildings closed pal.  Youll have to come back tomorrow.
Go. Im sorry, you should just go...
What kind of man does that!?
You look forward to this party all year.  Whats with you today?
Fine, shes the kids dog.  Lets go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
Wait a second.  You want me, dont you?
I mean...wow...off the charts great.
No?
Excuse me?
I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if Im lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...Im sick of it.
We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
You mean this chocolate cake?
Cmon.
Thank you...
Say it, Jack...
Jack...can we afford all this?
I need to tell you something.
I never used to be like this, Kate.  I had it all figured out.  No doubts, no regrets.
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
Youre so...beautiful...
Dont do that...
Its been interesting, thats for sure.
Kate...
I'm sorry...
So youre not at a non- profit firm?
Please. Lets just go have a cup of coffee. Thats all Im asking for. Im sure theres another flight to Paris tonight.
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, lets get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
Peter.  I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
He certainly has your number, Alan.
For one thing, you like expensive things.
Damn...damn...damn...
Don't you have anywhere to go?
Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
You didnt seem to mind offering to help me on Christmas day when you were unwrapping that Prada bag I gave you.
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
How'd you know it was me?
What about his first born?
I had it at four.
We had a tough year.
Ben --
We're working as hard as we can --
I'll be watching over you.
About me?  How sweet.
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
You look like an eighties rock band.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
You're really cramping my style here.
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl.
I'm driving.
Johnny?  Did you see Ben?
How's the IPO?
Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Come on, Ben, come on...
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
<u>Abort</u>?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
But I'm not done with the machine --
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
I, uh, think I remember the number.
It has to be the cloud.  It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
What?
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when --
Reed.  I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
When I walked out, I waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
I found a broken gasket, from space --
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
What's going on?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
You said it was urgent.
Okay to proceed.
I told you to cut down on the sugar.
Time's up... We'll have to take them out immediately.
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
Wish I knew why.
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.
[LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]
Difficult? He's impossible!
Yes, a fistula too small to show up on the X-rays.
Air bubbles!... Doctor --
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
Look at that...they're changing color...
No need to get up --
Thank you for saving my life.
Such as?
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.
But that isn't possible.
What can we do?
It's against my better Judgment...
Removal Point? What're you talking about!
Only to the naked eye.  Those corpuscles -- carrying oxygen -- give the stream its color. But the rest of the plasma's very much like sea water. An ocean of life...
Mind letting me in on what's going on out there?
"Yet all the suns that light the Corridors of the Universe shine dim, Before the blazing of a Single Thought -- "
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
At this size, I would certainly think so.
In a way -- yes. Those are impurities imbedded in the Lung after a lifetime of 'Civilization.' Carbon from smoke and smog -- specks of dust --
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.
We're entering the Lymphatic System. Those are nuclei of cells, lining a Duct.
I don't believe that.
May I?
What'd you do that for?
That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.
I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern.  I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help...
Come on -- it's no use!
Yes, there is.
That's it...
Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.
The Wall's transparent...
...What do you mean, you decided not to park here?
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Drop that fucking money!
...Is this a fucking joke?
Just in town on business. Just in and out. Ha ha! A little of the old in-and-out!
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
Or your fucking wife, you know.
You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.
Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
...Who's Jean?
...Blood has been shed.
Three people. In Brainerd.
That's right. And we need more money.
Blood has been shed. We've incurred risks, Jerry. I'm coming into town tomorrow. Have the money ready.
You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles! You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already!
We had us a deal here for nineteen- five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen-five!
One hunnert's the best we can do here.
Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you. When're you due?
They can really take over, that's for sure.
Yah.
So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
Yah.
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
They said they were goin' to the Twin Cities?
Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.
I'm talkin' about your potential.
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
We're not horse-trading here, Wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing.
What's the next step here, Jerry?
So you're goin' to the Gophers on Sunday?
...Yah, okay...
I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here -
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
...Mr. Lundegaard?
Yah, but -
I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
Yah, how much money was that?
Jerry Lundegaard.
Well, what do ya mean?
Where're you going?
Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -
Are you calling Stan?
Yah, pretty good.
Yah, you said you'd have a think about it. I understand it's a lot of money -
lot. It's a limited -
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -
Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty -
All the more reason!  I don't want you - with all due respect, Jerry - I don't want you mucking this up.
No, see -
Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?
Well, that's okay, I just -
Yah, well, see, I did that, and I haven't been able to get 'em, so I thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya.
Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal.
Geez, you okay, Margie?
...Well, that passed.
There's two of 'em, Lou!
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
How's it look, Marge?
...Geez.
...You can sleep, hon. It's early yet.
Yah, that's me.
...What can I get ya?
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
It's okay, Mike - Should we get together another time, ya think?
Yep.
Yah?
Oh. Oh, my.
Gustafson's accountant.
Sorry - didn't copy.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
...Chief Gunderson?
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
...So?
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
The first rule of Project --
You are a moron.
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
Better than I've ever been in my life.
That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations.
I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
It means it was homemade.
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
No, you can't die of insomnia.
We need to talk.
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
It becomes an addiction.
I'll take the parasites.
So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day?  I want ascending bowel cancer.
Looks like this is goodbye.
In case we want to switch nights.
That's the idea -- we split them.
Look, this is a bad time...
Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
This could go on for hours.
What are you doing here?
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
It's time for you to leave.
You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up.
I don't know ...
You feel nothing?
Well, that's a relief.  Thank you.
I think everything's okay here.
Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
You hear that?
That... sawing and hammering.
No.
Yeah?
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
What?
You have to get out of here.  Leave as soon as possible.  Go to any rural town, away from any major city...
What happened... ?
Who did this to you?
Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
You were in here last Thursday night.
You're the one who did this to me. You're Mr. Durden, sir.  Tyler Durden.
One minute.  This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
What do you do, Tyler?
I mean -- for a living.
Well, I have to file a claim...
Don't I?
No, I...
Can I stay at your place?
Thank you.
They're called "cigarette burns."
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's how long it's up there.
Why not you?  I'm letting you go first.  Do it.
Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.
How do you feel?
We've crossed the threshold.  You want to call it off?
Same here.
Where's your car?
"I am Joe's Lungs."  It's written in first person.  "Without me, Joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells."  There's a whole series -- "I am Joe's Prostate."
What are you reading?
A guy came to fight club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough.  After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.
You're sure?
Hey... don't knock librarians.
Promise you won't.
You want to finish her off?
Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the back of my hand.
Stop it.  This is your pain -- your burning hand.  It's right here.  Look at it.
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
What... ?
Six months advance pay.  Six months!
I asked you what you studied.
I feel sick.
Hey.
Why wasn't I involved from the beginning?  You and I started fight club together.
What the hell ... ?!
You're too young.  Sorry.
"Applicant?"
There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  Now look what you've done!
What about Marla?
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
Yes...
I've got everything.  The bombs.  The army.  I've got Marla.
Bob was a grown man.  In any great struggle, there will be casualties. Wouldn't that be implicit in the name?  Project "Mayhem."
Can't you call it off... ?
What the fuck -- ?
Why... why... why... ?
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart...
Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
Did you hear what I just said?!
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
Would you rather be dead?
I didn't beat it; I hid from it. If you were smart you'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog, because what little life you have left is over as you know it.  Don't make new friends, don't fall in love, and don't ever bother trying to save others.  That's the worst killer of them all.
What did you see?
A mortician.  He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us.
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place.
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again.  Did you?
What?
What?
Are you Jorge Cruz?
Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means "good luck" in Jewish.
Do you remember what triggered it all?
Nora's not coming.  She refuses to leave her son.
Um, Kimberly?  This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down.
But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?
What is it?  What are you?
I mean it.  Take care of it.
I'm sorry.  I'm just so happy that you're safe.
That's why I was there last night.
"It?"
That... him?
Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
Can't you open the door?!
Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!
Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.
You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead.
Fag.
I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father...
Cuticle lacerations.
His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps.  And no... escapes.
SHUT UP, BILLY!
You guys are real... aren't you?
I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did.  They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week.  Got a smoke?
Wow!
No radio source.  Nothing for the bad guys to triangulate on.
Yeah.  Why not?
You read me, Brewer?
And a beat-to-shit AK?  Every twelve-year-old in Nam's got one of those.
I've seen worse places.
Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
What's that?
These guys look like they'd sell their mothers.
How you doing, Brewer?
Gawd, you look awful.
Can you handle the door gun?
You're gonna love it.
Why's that?
Christ.  How'd you get here?
I know.  I go with you.
What was that?
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
All this is for us?
You're out of your depth, Trautman. Way out.  I'm acting correctly here. Not you.  Not your gung-ho jungle ace.  It's over.  Walk away.
Who're you?
I hear you're not enjoying it here.
Congressional Medal of Honor.
This will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
Will it hurt?
...So he says to me, "you'll never find another man like me"...I said, "please, men like you have one hand on their dicks and the other hand on their mother's leg... I said, there's the door - take a trip.
What?
I think some people are meant to be alone.  Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts... 
I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch.
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
I'm sorry.
<u>What</u>!
I'm not seeing anyone else.  I really was attacked.
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
I was not with a woman last night.  I was out with Parry.
He's not a moron.
Well talk back.  He won't bite you.
I've got to put these tapes in some kind of order... and... Oh, I should get my sports jacket cleaned...  ... There's coffee if you want...
What?
... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little.
... I'd like to focus on my career - - now than I can, now that everything's all right... Parry's taken care of... and... Like I said, I feel like I know a lot more now and I don't...
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
So, Edwin, baby, this is Sunrise Confession time... what have you got for us?
Yeah, I know the place.  It's one of those chic <u>yuppie</u> gathering holes.
Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?
Can I help you?
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
Isn't that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier. Poor Little Gloria. They ruined them! THEY ATE THEM ALIVE!
Hello Lydia?
Huh-huh.
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
... I've got a right to say something.  I mean, you're tying my hands here!  They say you're not ready to know.
Parry.
What's her name?
That's O.K.
Isn't it great up here... He's gone now, but we had him on the run! We would've had his ass if we had horses! He's running scared!
SAW WHO!!?
Parry...
You can't do this! This is New York! Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York..It's...it's too Midwestern.
I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
Holdin' my penis...
Will you stand still so I can do this!
You a fag too?
Are you all right?
Well, we have plenty of those.  Right over here.  We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
Tell me more. I want to know everything.
Well, it's enough for me.
What are we about to do?
Excuse me...
... It's not just from tonight.  I've known you for a long time.  I see you come out of work every day.  I walk with you to lunch.  I know what you order... I see you buy Baby Ruths before going back in...  I know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore...  ... I know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated  ... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and I love you.   I love you.  I think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and I would be knocked out several times if I even got just a first kiss.  But I'll be back in the morning.  And I won't be distant.  And I will call if you let me... But I still don't drink coffee.
My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!
I'll go out with you, or I'll stay here, and do anything you'd like for me to do... if you'll just do one thing. If you'll tell me that you love me.
Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.
Okay, Ray...
Bobby...
We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.
Well...
Hey, mack!
Can I get you anything else?
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
I don't make the rules.
You want me to hold the chicken.
We been wantin' to ask you something. Are you the guy on YV?
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
I just can't look at you.
Robert, I have to tell you something...
I'd rather drive up myself and... maybe go into Canada after... And I can't stay long, Tita, probably a week, at the most.
Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming...
How long have you been staying here?
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
Do you want some gingerbread?
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
Besides piano and swimming, what else do you do?
You had no inner feeling?
Wait...
Catherine...
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
Where are you going?
No, I want to talk to you now. I have to explain something about...
I'm sorry everything's been so confusing, but I have to go, Robert...
No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...
I hope you feel at home, Robert.  I'm really glad you're here.
Robert, do you mind?
Suit yourself. But I'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell.
No, you're not. Go ahead and take your time.
I don't think that's true.
You know, just after I came back off tour with the Betenthaller Quartet, Dad, myself and Herbert had a summit conference about you...
You better hold onto your tongue!
Mass production is what does it.
Yeah, it could be adorable...
John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...
I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
What?
Please don't scream at me. I like you, but I don't like the way your attitude is.
I wanna go out with you, I want to be part of your life. I want you to treat me the way a girlfriend should be treated.
What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
Who are you?
So watcha doin'?
What are you doin' here?
That's it?
I look good, that's it. So what else do you do for these girls?
Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?
Fa what?
Wha'?
They are?
Amanda is Eddie's cousin.
Yo, remember from the pool, that girl?
The one with the phat ass?
How do I know you're not lying.
Where you know Amanda from?
I know how ta get him back if you want.
Fletch!
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this very much anymore... but we have. Got rid of a lot of minorities that way.
Thanks for coming down to see us.
This one's going to be even more fun.
Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.
Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
That's two.
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place?
Oh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate. Have you got a paper bag, or something.
Is there anything particular you're looking for?
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
Are you serious?
I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.
Right.
I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....
Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd Aviation?
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.
It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you.  One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...
Alan Stanwyk.
Here's my proposition, Mr. Nugent.
Why don't you try suicide?
I have the same problem with my help.
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
Thanks.
I overheard it. He thinks you're completely out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. If I were you, I'd just chuck it, Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat three full pages on Sunday.
She's cute as a button.
Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
That's a strange combination.
What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.
You ordered it here?
I really should change.
Lunch...
You were in the war?
Why'd you let me in?
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
So?
What are you talking about?
He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true.
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...
No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...
And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.
Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
No wonder.
I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.
I never read the paper.
What's the spread on the game tonight?
Gummy and two cops...
You're onto something. That's good. What?
Fletch, you want an apology?
Who's Frieda?
Yes?
Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.
You don't know the Underhills?
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
But I ain't got you...
Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.
What cheap shit... hey, waiter!
Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
Thanks for the promotion, man.
Your tip paid off.  Jazz, this is Sam the Sleazebag.  Sam the Sleazebag, this is Jazz, my secretary.
All your friends call you Jazz.
Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.
So what about this watch?
Why did you interrupt?  Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
I don't know, what was the case?
Ah, an obvious choice.
What an interface!
Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?
You okay?
What?  Jesus, tell me!
Spunk, come back...
Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...
Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...
I know the feeling.  This must be hell.  Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.
This is boring, guys.
I'm afraid so, you want her?
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
I can't kill this kid's father...
Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
Gut feeling.
Ouch.
I'm sorry...
Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
So, did you find my dad?
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
I need someone to help me with my case load, you interested?  This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay. You know what I'm saying?
What are you running from?
Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane.  He won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. Let's face it.  After today, the California Raisins aren't gonna hire you.
I want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.
Terrible thing, but good career move.  His record sales have gone way up.  I'll just have to create a new Black Vomit.
It doesn't have to be like this?
I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?
Kill them.  Not quickly.
You'd said something about proof...
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
You're that guy, the private eye.
That's cute.  You're funny.
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
This isn't music!
I don't believe it.  Getting paid to be the asshole you always were.
So...
I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
What's my name?
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
Well try, okay?
Did you pick up the car?
Calm down -- Henri!  You must trust me -- this is an extremely complicated situation to which there is a simple solution if you do exactly what I tell you.  It's worth more money to you.
Allo... Salvatore...
Regarde mon pcheur de baleine... Tu sais il va faire trs froid cet hiver.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Il est en retard.
Une erreur!  C'est gnial.  C'est une vedette  la tlvision.  Il peut aller partout sans tre souponn... En plus il a besoin de fric.
We must follow it.
There'll be someone else.
It's beautiful.
I got no music!
There's nobody like that on six.
A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here alone.
Mr. and Mrs. Alain Charnier, would be another.  He's in shipping.
What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?
What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin' from the cops?
Why not?
When ya go back on?
Yeah, we got the Westbury covered like a tent.
Who stuck up the laundromat?
Who is that guy?
No, you?
Toy wit' this will ya.
What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.
Hey, Bo.
Where'd you get this fag shit?
Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South.  It was actually the first railroad through New York City.
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
Oh, my God!  What is that?!  Why you showing me this shit!?  JESUS!  JESUS! Get those away from me!
They around?
Where's the collar, in the cells?
Oh, man.  Hope it ain't like this in Baltimore tomorrow.
Oh, yeah.  Damn.  My watch is busted.
Gotta be another way up, Frank.
I'm off.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
You ready?
Where are you transmitting from?
Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?
What the hell...
How could this be happening?
You sound...ground up...?
It's really you, isn't it?
On the job?
Dad, you there?  You okay?
Right here, Chief.  Sorry I lost you last night.  Damn thing keeps cutting out.
Are you alright"?
What?  What is it?
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
Why not just get the cops to watch the bar?
What are we like in...1998?
Yeah, you betcha.
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
John, you still there?
Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
We got him!  Dad you got him!
C'mon, man.  Get inside.  I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo.
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
You're not looking too good.
Maybe you outta lay off a little...
Which means he probably knew her.
Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy, Satch.
Got a minute?
Are you a good cop, John?
Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say "hello."
Huh.
Hell-
Going?  How do you mean?
What is that?
That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
Breakfast?
What're you doing?
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
Do you want a beer or not?
Destroy the evidence?  No, man!
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
No.  I got here just before you did.
Let's spread out and check all the rooms.  Outside, too.  You stay with me.
You know, I'm not sure I could live anywhere else.  The nights are always so peaceful and quiet.
Why did you come back here?
What happened that night?
In that little thing?
See anything?
What?
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
Darren, we better turn around.
That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.
Whaddya mean?
I thought Jason was only a legend?
What?
It's all over.
Okay, give it back.
They did show up.  Isn't that great?
But what if they try and scare us?
It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.
I sympathize with you kids.  The best I can do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.
Anything else?
What's the problem here?
Listen...don't you worry about Ed. He'll come around.  He's too good a Sheriff to let you give him the slip.
Everything'll work out.  Trust me on that.
Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
Tell me.
I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
Oh, my dear God...
I've told you the truth.
She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
He's undefeated, you know that?  Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is.
What murders?
Did you hear that?
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
Where's the radio?
Christ...where's Rennie??
Dear Christ...
She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
Did you find Rennie?
He's doing the best he can, Charles.
Can't we at least talk about it?
You pushed me...
So, are you having fun yet?
Did you have an accident in the lake?
I got you a present.
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
We must abandon.
Elliot?
Don't talk like that.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
But didn't we know it would happen?
Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca?
The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.
We're making too much of this.
We were thinking of putting in a pool.
Had to be him.
What are we talking about?
Of course I saw it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
Because we're completely mismatched.
It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.
Do you want to get some coffee?
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
Will I believe you when you tell me something?
What else?
What else?
Am I really so deeply repugnant?
Your father said you might be here.
Opening night, Lillian.
Alma Wetzel.
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
Life is good.
All the failures, all the fatalism.
Go way. I'll call a cop.
Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
A grandmother. God bless you.
It's the kid's lucky day.
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
They're my team.
I had lunch with Joanna. She said she told you about Peter. You weren't concerned, she said.
Sidney remains optimistic.
Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
Yes, Peter.
What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?
What's good?
And he has finer moments now and then.
Say it again.
I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
So do I. Over and over.
No one's waiting.
If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
What? Come on, Paisley.
Here, you see? Even the South African papers apologize -- "a monstrous attack."
Oww!
It is the work of untouchables.
"Take a sixth step, that we may follow our vows in life."
"...what shape it will take." Jinnah has -- what?
Just an admirer...
That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this "farm"...
I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine.
They're calling you "Bapu." I thought it meant father.
Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. In South Africa the numbers were small...
If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it.
And Jinnah?
Do you remember much of South Africa?
I'm sure I'm fit for at least five hundred miles.
I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!
Who is that young man?
I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.
I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru.
You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him?
They're sparing no one, I see.
I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such "exception" to.
...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest.  And it still goes on.
Could we cut all news off? I know --
I'm sorry, there's no way we can.
I guess so.  Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not...  ...universally loved.  He was leading the cut-backs in the program.  You're looking at a room full of motives.
According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.
--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that?
From what budget?
We believe we have a suspect.
Twelve have a mission within the week.
Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?
Suit yourself.
It's not too late to back out.
At least up there your piss will be worth something.  You'll all be showering in it, right?
Call German.
We can't stay here.
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
You really had other offers?
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
How are you, Jerome?
I have your samples ready.
Why have you done this?
No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--

Yeah.
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about <i>you?</i>  Where were you last night?
So you didn't do it after all.
So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
A year is a long time.
--I've read your profile.  I don't know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own.  You can have other children.
Hello, McCoy.
Three... Rudy got ambitious.
That's your problem.
Don't think too badly of her... After all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman.
You okay?
What's Beynon got set up?
Boring.
Really?
$250,000 right off the top.
Promise you won't laugh.
Doc...
They checked in.
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
Why didn't you tell me?
Texas is a big state.
What do you want to do?
We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.
No scars?
I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.
Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
So what?
You're crazy.
You okay?
What now?
Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.
Gonna knock down a wall?
You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.
Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
How was that?
Let's just get to the border.
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
That's what I want.
You got it.
I've got to stop.
Yes.
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
You knew what I'd do.
Well, he drove it into the river.
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
Who paid you to see me off?
Address?
Everyhing go off all right?
I want to talk to you later.
Once a week you like a gentleman?
What was bugging Frank?
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?
Yes.
Yes, while he was here.
Could you do me a favour?
You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?
To the demon king's castle, of course.
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
And what was that?
Who's setting you up in this place?
Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?
Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?
Tell me about the girl.
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Who set it up?  Eric?
Then he must have pulled her.
And you didn't know her last name?
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?
That must be interesting.
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.
Nowt.
Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?
I'm staying with a friend.
Will this do?
Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?
And what you going to do?
You're a bastard.
They're friends of mine.
You coming back?
Is he?
Didn't you know this is my home town?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Jack! I didn't like that.
You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.
Scotch, please.
Eric told me of your bereavement.
Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it.
Gerald wants to see him first.
Bollock naked with his socks still on?
Ask me?
What's that? A hundred?
Four hundred?
You're not seeing me?
I'll see you, then.
All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens to us all.
We're stuck with this...
...that's right...
Shoes, boots, yes...
Who?
You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.
Just the act.
You fucking build it!  Men come...
...you're absolutely right.
Should do something to them.
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
You haven't talked to him.
We're just "talking" about it.
As an idea.
Because, because, you know, it's a crime.
Is that what I said?
A job with Graff.
He'd give me a job.
Yes.  It is, George.  Yes.  It's a big decision.  And it's a big reward.  It's a big reward.  For one night's work.  But it's got to be tonight.
It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth.  "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."
Dave.
That's ridiculous.
Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?
Do you need five grand?
You need money?  Is that the...
What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
I do?
Can we get some coffee...?
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...
Were the leads...
A waste of time?  Why?
They aren't?
Why don't you think so?
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
Will you excuse...
Read it.  Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.  What happened here?
Shelly, the Machine, Levene.
Wh...wh...Wha...?
...how can you talk to me that... that...
I don't know, George, why?
...Come in here...I work here, I don't come in here to be mistreated...
Moss...Who told him?
Hey, hey, hey, easy friend.  That's the "Machine." That is Shelly "The Machine" Lev...
What is this "you say"?  A deal kicks out...I got to eat.  Shit, Williamson, shit.  You...Moss... Roma...look at the sheets...look at the sheets.  Nineteen eighty, eighty-one...eighty-two...six months of eighty-two...who's there? Who's up there?
Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass.  I need the leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you.
Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something...
Money.  A fortune.  Money lying on the ground.  Murray?  When was the last time he went out on a sit? Sales contest?  It's laughable. It's cold out there now, John. It's tight.  Money is tight.  This ain't sixty-five.  It ain't.  It just ain't.  See?  See?  Now, I'm a good man--but I need a...
...ah, fuck this...
Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
Then put me on the board.
I can't close these leads, John. No one can.  It's a joke.  John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads.  As a "test," alright?  As a "test" and I promise you...
I will close.  John, John, ten percent.  I can get hot.  You know that...
What are we going to say?
Alright.
Well, I want to tell you something, fella, wasn't long I could pick up the phone, call Murray and I'd have your job.  You know that?  Not too long ago.  For what?  For nothing. "Mur, this new kid burns my ass." "Shelly, he's out." You're gone before I'm back from lunch.  I bought him a trip to Bermuda once...
Get 'em to me!
Why I don't...
Excuse me...
How do you know I made it up?
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
I sold them to Jerry Graff.
Five thousand.  I kept half.
Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.
What sales...?  I just closed eighty-two grand...Are you fuckin'...I'm back...I'm back, this is only the beginning.
Abso...
The check's no good?
Why?
Shit.
"You do get the..."  Huh?  Huh?
Eight units?
Williamson, get on the phone, call Mitch...
And, and, and, I did it.  And I put a kid through school. She...and...Cold calling, fella. Door to door.  But you don't know. You don't know.  You never heard of a streak.  You never heard of "marshaling your sales force..." What are you, you're a secretary, John.  Fuck you.  That's my message for you.  Fuck you and kiss my ass. You don't like it, I'll go talk to Jerry Graff.  Period.  Fuck you. Put me on the board.  And I want three worthwhile leads today and I don't want any bullshit about them and I want 'em close together 'cause I'm going to hit them all today.  That's all I have to say to you.
Oh, Christ.
I wanted to speak with you about...
Ray is director of all European sales and services for American Ex...  But I'm saying you haven't had a meal until you've tasted...I was at the Lingks' last...as a matter of fact, what was that service feature you were talking about...?
Well, Ray was eating at one of his company's men's home in France...the man's French, isn't he?
Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
I'm sorry...?
Rick...?
Yeah.
Well, you want to swing by the Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?
You don't count Saturday.
She wants her money back.
I'm...
What...?
What power?
What?  What?  What, Jim: I tell you what, let's get out of here...let's go get a drink.
What are the police doing?
Guess what the Machine did?
You hear what I said?
Fuck you.
They didn't get your contract.  I filed it before I left.
They didn't get the contracts.
They took some of the con...
You closed him yesterday.
...you want to go out today...?
Three?  I count two.
Yes.
They say Fanucci has a license from Maranzalla himself to work this neighborhood.
Vitone!  Our driver has drunk too much wine.
Bought at the airport.
It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true.
How are you, honey?  You've met Merle, haven't you.  He was with me in Vegas.
The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.
You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.
Then why do you come to me?
Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party.
What's 'cent' Anne?'
Deanna, will you get back into the house!
Would you like some?
The child cannot harm you.
Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose.
Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie &quot;Five-Angels&quot;...thought you were never coming West.
We were all upset about that.
Hiya, Freddie Corleone.
Count on me; that's my specialty.
The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move.
I don't have a lot to say, Michael.
I didn't know it was a hit.  I swear to you I didn't know.  Johnny Ola contacted me in Beverly Hills -- said he wanted to talk.  He said you and Roth were in on some big deal, and there was a place for me in it if I could help them out. They said you were being tough on the negotiation, and if they had a little bit of help, they could close it fast and it would be good for you.
Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my.  Did you ever think of that. Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.  Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!
The 'patrone' is here.
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
You're going to talk to him now.
I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?
They can come in now.
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
They are everywhere!
The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew.' His passport's been invalidated except for return to the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship.  They turned him down.
I think I prefer to see my client privately.
The Roman Empire... when a plot against the Emperor failed, the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes.
No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.
Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.
Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.
Whose orders are these?
Why too late?
I represent the interests of the Corleone family.  We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
There are still things I have to do.
No, I meant lose his family.
I like sporting events -- I really enjoy watching them in the afternoon. One of the things I love about this country.  I loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919...I heard you had some trouble.
What a mistake; people behaving like that, with guns.  It was my understanding we left all that behind.  But, let me tell you, the important thing is that you're all right.  Good health is the most important thing; more than success; more than power; more than money.
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.
This doubles my investment.
You're a careful kid, and that's good.  But look.  An international dispatch on the wire service. American journalism, not propaganda. The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels.  All but their radio station.
It occurred to me: the police are paid to fight, and the Rebels are not.
You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola.
I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights.  We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country.  Are you?
Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
Says who?
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming.  We could have prepared something for you.
I want you to help me take my revenge.
I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.
This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me.
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?
Your family all seem to be okay in the other houses; your Mother's still sleeping.
Rosato, where's your brother?
He don't want to talk?
Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  That puts me and the other New York families against you.
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity.  Her rent will remain what it was.
What's that mean?
No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
The look on your face!  You're not marriage material.  You're not even boyfriend material.  You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
I'm not married.
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
You did not know?
It's not what you think.
The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
Or would you prefer a beer?
These are your paintings?
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
Yeah?  What were some of your movies?
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone.
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders.  Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?
It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.
I'm sorry.  I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
I never thought you were.
So we understand each other?
Can I see what you did so far?
Sorry.  Not today.
Oh dear.  I <u>have</u> made you nervous.
Isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy?  Do you have to rub my nose in it?
Mr. Boone.  You're not due to cut the lawn until Wednesday.
This was World War I?
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
Good afternoon, Clayton.
What was that about?
Neither of us really belongs here.
Let's get out of this funk hole
You're much wider than I am.  You won't want to attempt to get into my pants.
Is that --?
After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches?
-- that I was a Marine.  Which is true.  You filled in the rest.
You know what he did when I called him?  He laughed.  He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  Said it was a good lesson for me.  Not to try to fill his shoes.
Do you mind?
I said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, "The only monsters are here."  I was wondering which here you meant.
But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory?
No.  It won't do.
You are much too human.
Why?
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
I'm not that way.  Get it through your fucking head.  I don't want to mess with you.
Look, if you want to die do it yourself!
Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock.
This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times.
Calm down, Clay.  Just calm down. We'll watch it.
Then take the pills.
I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars --
I didn't ask George to invite you.
In a manner of speaking.  I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.
Oh no, my dear.  You look absolutely amazing.  There's no way I can compete with you.  The scene is yours.
Uh-oh.  The way you look at me, James.  What have you done this time?
And you said there'd be some of me left.  Nobody's going to know me in this getup.
Jimmy.  How are you?
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
Is that Boris?  Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.
Hanna?  Who's the new yardman?
Mr. Kay, sir.
Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.
How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?
He looks plenty big.  You won't need my help if anything goes flooey.
Who was that at the door?
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.
Will that be good for you, Mr. Kay?
Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
That's funny, Mr. Whale.
Then the rumors are true?
That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is Born"?  I never guessed.
My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
How are you?
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
Sound it out for me.
Get out of here, Ray --
Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ...
I'll catch you later, Randall --
Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ...
okay ...
Got it ...
Yeah.
Lookit Kip. All grown up...
You guys have any skills at all?
What color?
No. That was Higgins ....
All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
Walked like a bastard... Skippin' stones and shit..
How are we supposed to--
Any word, Kip -- ?
That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving
Why didn't you tell me?
The photo album. I get nostalgic around this time of year ...
I know...
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
Okay, then ... I just go to the Marriott and I'm set ...
You goin' home?
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
You all right -- ?
This has nothing to do with any of that --
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
"Over--"  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
You don't think so, huh?
We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean
You hear me?
Ain't we good-timing here ... ?
You okay -- ?
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
Toby...
What are you doing here?
You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ?
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
You know of one -- ?
Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.
Buy you a drink?
On account of Mitch?
And here I am...
Hey.
No whistles, but a Club You bring a hack -- ?
So, you seeing anybody?
Arright ... Enough ... I can't have you bellying up to my heart again, man, f you can't help falling off the stool. But he puts his mouth to her ears ...
Stop. What about Maserati Boy?
The alarms go off ...
You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ...  Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ...
What are you doing... ?
This time it's for real?
The hard part ...
Is he still working here ?
Some crew you got ...
I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
Okay, then... Otto?
Split it up. Any word on Donny?
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.
Don't go busting my balls. Okay?
I don't want any more of that Shit.
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
Here. Take it.  Now I gotta turn my back on you.
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
What're you doing? What about the car?
The bag with the envelopes.
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.
Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.
I told Jimmy the cops took our cars and froze our bank accounts and he offered to get me some money. Be wants to know what's happening. You gotta meet him.
Who's gonna do that?
I flushed it down the toilet.
What about the schools?
You got money for your bullshit television, don't you?  I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money?
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.
You want the melon?
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
It's a fait accompli?
Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy!
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
I hate to do dishes.
He didn't call?
What kind of person doesn't call?
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
If you knew those fucking kids. They're nuts. Especially that Tommy. What am I going to do with them?
Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. We should go there sometime.
She's sharp as a marble.
She didn't do it again did she?
Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish?
What do we got?
Hey, thanks for comin' out.
Who'd you call?
It's a way outta here.
Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
You're kiddin' me.
What class?
Hi.
Is this a bad time?
Jesus.
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
Did she get my Double Burger?
Come on, Will...
You got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch.
Did your Uncle get arrested?
Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.
I'm not sure--
Will, our offer starts you at eighty- four thousand a year, plus benefits.
To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.
All right, are we gonna have a problem?
Yes. Under two conditions.
--that?--
I told you to cooperate with these people.
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us? We're trying to settle a bet.
Sean.
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
Yeah.
He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?
You moved?
Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
He married his cousin.
--And confuse him--
Oh, come on, Sean--
Oh, that's nice--
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
I got one of those too.
Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?
Who is he?
Well, she out did herself today...
I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart--
I might understand that.
Who is "Danny Terrio?"
Probably not.
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?
"A History of the United States, Volume I." If you want to read a real history book, read Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States." That book will knock you on your ass.
You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books.
Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.
Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
Crayons?
Maybe you should be a patient and sit down.
If you ever disrespect my wife again...I will end you.
You know, I was on this plane once. And I'm sittin' there and the captain comes on and is like "we'll be cruising at 35,000 feet," and does his thing, then he puts the mike down but forgets to turn it off. Then he says "man, all I want right now is a blow-job and a cup of coffee." So the stewardess goes runnin' up towards the cock-pit to tell him the mike's still on, and this guy in the back of the plane goes "don't forget the coffee!"
My wife's dead.
Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans?  I read your book last night.
Why not?
What did you think?
But you can't give back to them, Will.
Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation.
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
Gotta go with the belt there...
Don't fuck with me.
That's what you want?
No. Thank you.
You suck.
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
You have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Yeah.
I have twelve big brothers.
Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?
You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me ask you a question? Do you have a photographic memory?
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--
I want you to come with me.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
What about your twelve brothers?
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
Yeah.
Take care.
All right, mister. I'll go. You just show your license to contrack, an' then you make out a order--where an' when an' how much you gonna pay--an' you sign it an' we'll go.
Twicet now I've fell for that line. Maybe he needs a thousan' men. So he get's five thousan' there, an' he'll pay fifteen cents a hour. An' you guys'll have to take it 'cause you'll be hungry.  'F he wants to hire men, let him write it out an' say what he's gonna pay. Ast to see his license. He ain't allowed by law to contrack men without a license.
She'll prob'ly ride like a bull calf-- but she'll ride!
Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look?
But it ain't runnin' away, Ma. All I wanta do is go away with another fella an' look aroun' for work by ourself--
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
Well, you said anybody can waltz... How'm *I* doin'?
Lots must a died, too.
She's hotter'n a heifer.
Looks like about a mile. Reckon she'll make it?
We just picked him up on the way in. He went away this mornin' when the rate dropped.
So long.
That's not your affair. Name.
House 25. Number's on the door.
Two and a half cents.
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
That cut you got?
Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight.
Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!
She's settlin'.
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
I'll tell 'em. But I don't know how. Never seen so many guys with guns. Wouldn't even let us talk today.
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
They shore don't waste no time!  Take her out.
How about a lift, mister?
Get to what?
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.
An' the nex' thing you know you'll be out, because they got it all figgered down to a T--until the harvest is in you're a *migrant* worker--afterwards, just a bum.
What's he fixin' to do, ma?
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.
You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?
I like the tent better.
How 'bout it?
Muley tol' me what happened, Ma. Are we goin' to California true?
Mad, Ma?
How about it, Ma?
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.
Fust thing I'll get is coffee, cause ever'body been wantin' that, an' then some flour an' bakin' powder an' meat. Better not get no side- meat right off. Save that for later. Maybe Sat'dy. Got to get some soap too. An' milk. Rosasharn's got to have some milk.
That Casy. He might a been a preacher, but--he seen a lot a things clear. He was like a lantern--he helped mw see things too.
It's jus' till we get some distance. Then you can come out.
What is it?
They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.
I been thinkin' about us, too--about our people livin' like pigs, an' good rich lan' layin' fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'. An' I been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled--
No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.
Me neither.  It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by. 
This ain't a groc'ry store. We got bread to make san'widges with.
Listen!  That's them! Them lights! Come on, we got to hide out!
Fact of the matter, Muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more. It don't even break even, much less show a profit. One man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. You just pay him a wage and take *all* the crop.
How you get all this money?
Either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck, or somepin. He can't stay here.
Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it.
Heh'o Tom.  This is Connie, my husband.
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
What's this?
You don't...
You're so funny...
Marty, you haven't changed a bit!
We had pictures put on, that way everybody knows who everybody was!
Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing adds up to nothing... you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all. One day you're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it...
I'd come to the realization that everything I'd based my life on was false. And that my life had no meaning.
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
Jesus...
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
How long has it been?
Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.
Yes.
Hello...?
You're fucking psycho.
Do you want to get a drink first?
--Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--
Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.
You kill people. 
I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
What else? Say more.
Do you like the people you work with?
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain.
What do you want?
I told them to kill you and they didn't.
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
Is that right?
It's okay. It's Martin The door begins to open revealing Debi and Newberry.
The more things change, the more they Goddamned well stay the same.
Well?
Did you see Blank in there?
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
And not show it to me. Ever again.
They blame you for the compromise.
You haven't looked at the dossier.
We had a good laugh, didn't we?
Debi's house.
No. You drove us here.
Why not?
This is Annie MacLean.
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
Doesn't matter.
You okay?
Are you shy, Mr. Booker?
Son?
How did you meet her?
Everything under control?
I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set.
I don't know any other way, Annie.
Liz is taking care of him.  The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --
Oh, honey... What happened?
Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
What?
Oh. You didn't tell me.
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
I don't believe this!
Did he tell you that?
That's not true!
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
Nothing.
Look, I just wanted to say, I think it's great you're riding again. And... and I think I know why you, you needed to do it alone... without anyone knowing...
Well, then I do apologize... But what I'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not.
What did you say?
When? Tonight?
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
It's me.
Why did you go?
What did he say?
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit?
When are you coming home?
I miss you, Annie.
Good night.
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
You were right about coming here. I'm sorry for not thinking...
How are you feeling about work?
Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
No. I am a "tubab."
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?
Frank's a good man.
Sounds like something Tom would say.
It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks.
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.
I don't believe they'll expect that.
Ha...
They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother.
Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding...
We thought we lost him in the snow storm... Told the kids. Had a funeral for the damn thing. Finally, snow stops. Staring to warm up. I go out and start cleaning the truck... Goddamn if that dog doesn't jump out from the back seat covered in snow... I nearly stained myself.
Don't you go to school?
I wouldn't let happen.
Put the key in and turn it.  The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.
Where did you get Pilgrim from?
Are you afraid of anything?
My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
Have you heard from Judith's parents?
IT WAS MY TURN!
Don't be such a baby!
What are you looking at, young man?
Does a horse miss a saddle?
Well, that'll happen.
What stuff is that?
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
Welcome to our show!
Let's keep her.
Oh yeah? What's that?
I can't. Everybody who touches that thing gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested, I'm sorry.
What?
Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!
Damn!
One-handed!
Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.
Oh wow, we are fried.
And what's he do?
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.
Loser.  I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you.
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.
What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
I found it! I found it!
Oh, shit! He got me.
Yes!
What the hell is going on?
I'm Crash Override.
What the hell are you doing?
It's too much machine for you.
Thank you.
This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
What?
How?
I can't believe they decided you won.
Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
Gill.
It got you seven years probation. No computer, couldn't even use a touch tone phone.
Hello?
Good.
You're welcome.
Never fear. I is here.
We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and overlay files.
Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak, dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta...
Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?
You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?
Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
So what are we supposed to do?
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
What is it? What's wrong?
Thank you.
Hello, operator services.
Just one moment.
Purpose of visit?
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
I'll take you down there.
Are you two okay?
Its metal, god dammit its metal.
Shit!
When did this happen?
It's hard to tell, there all chewed up.
Can't you find somebody else?
Because the lights are all out.
Why wasn't I notified?
Four plus Myers.
Watch it.
We're going to Ben's. The phone never just rings at a police station.
Okay everybody, listen up. I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck, and I'm taking them outta town route 410. State police are on the way. Got that?
Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.
Jamie, sometimes it's...
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
Had enough?
Why don't you go make some coffee.
I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay?
You remember Lindsay don't you?
You won't come on too strong.
Logan, I want you to stay here in case the family gets back.
You got your riot gun?
Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
This is starting to spook me.
Oh Christ. Doc...
Where's that Deputy?
How's it powered?
These kids aren't likely to forget.
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.
You're going to be late!
It's been totally charted.
He was standing right here.
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
I've already lost it.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.
Fancy.
I don't want to.
Yes.
Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?
Yeah, sure.
You have the wrong feeling.
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.
What about the bogyman?
I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.
The bogyman!
Who is it?
Thorazin.
I couldn't if I tried.
What did he say?
Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil.
I love that.  That's my type.
And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
Oh, yeah.
Well, I live downtown.
You're joking.
But I'm seeing him.
Mm-hm.
I can't resist.
Is this your first job?
Yeah.
Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown...
Yeah.
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
Mm-hm.
I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.
What I'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I'd like to have them run some tests.
I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me.  The Easter Parade? You were right.  It had very special meaning for me.
Yeah.
Where are you headed?
Yeah, you would.
Uh, yes!
I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.
Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
Oh, you-you have that one?
Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
Lee... uh...
I know she must be a really passionate person.
You've been very cold to me tonight.
But it hasn't been forever. 
Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
Lee...
She has all the cooking talent.
You bet.
Where're you going?
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
Why not?
I want one with you.
Are you?
Well, what do you do?  Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what?  Do you, do you, do you phone them?
It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.
...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
Hi.  How's she doing?
Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?
Oh, Mom!
Why should I be afraid?
How about something to eat?
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
Mmm  you never know.  They might.  He's just trying to do the nice thing.
Me?
Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten.
What are you going to use for money?!
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
So you met somebody else?
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
You don't have a brain tumor.  He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY  No, naturally  they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
Can you understand how meaningless everything is?  Everything!  I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless.
No.
Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
Yeah?
I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
Ohh!
That's really nice!
What are you talking about?
What?  You're kidding!
I know.  H-how much do you need?
Ohh?
Don't you think she does?
Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.
Oh, Hannah!
Ouch!
You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
You found all this, all this out on one date?
Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song.
...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
Well, that...th-that's fine.
You treat me like a loser.
What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
My script?
Oh, so loosely.
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
Don't, no, please.  Will you-- No, don't...
Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
God!
Good.  How are you?
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
I'd never do that.
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
Well...
Have you?
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
No, I am.  I am.
No, the reason I ask is--
You're okay, though, huh?
But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script.
No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think.
Oh, it just came to me one day.
Oh!
Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
It's all right.
When'd you get here?
Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.
Yeah.
Dad...
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.
What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?
You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...
...<u>please</u>...
You know why that is?  Because there are so few things I need to forget. Would you agree, for the record, that I have not been read my rights?
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do."  Aren't you part of them anymore...?  Aren't you part of the FBI? 'No Girl's Allowed,' or <u>what</u>?  Have you transgressed...?
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
Who would that be.
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
You want to get married...?
Then you tell me, then.
That's right.
What, What, I can't hear you...
...he was <u>wealthy</u>...
How was America?
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
Hold up a minute...
If you would see him monument, look around you.
...thank you...  And how are you this evening, Doctor? No, we know that you're awake...
I like Popcorn...
...they're from Baltimore....
Now, why in the world would he do that?
Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
No, no, of course not.
Yes, I did.
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men 
No. 
Yes sir, I saw it. 
I am all attention.
S'hotter inside than it is <u>outside</u>...even with the air conditioning. 
Waited too long, hon...?  
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
...you told me you were studying for your examination by the <u>Studiolo</u>...
No, this is <u>pleasure</u>...
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. 
I saw a man, somewhat <u>fatigued</u>. Quickly dressed, a bit dishevelled.  In the middle of the day.  An old story.  And then I saw the clothing was <u>fresh</u>--therefore:  a man who dressed at <u>home</u>.  And then I remarked the new <u>wedding</u> ring.  And so:  the <u>story</u> gave me pause.  A lovely story.  A new, and a beloved <u>wife</u>.  I wish you joy. 
My scar is a war-wound.
And?  Then?
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.
I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it seemed as if they, as if they...
I'd like to walk home with you, and...
...Franklin.
Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...
...may be the heat....
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
Thank you, Cordell.
ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
Our Mister <u>Frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
You should get Married.
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
I don't understand.
I want the money.
...<u>sadly</u>...
Thank you.
...what a lovely perfume.
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
What're they on about?
...a Dr. Fell.  A Brazilian, I think. Applying for Fanelli's post.
..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
For approval.
And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
But.  He was a night <u>watchman</u>.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  N'then they took me off.  I <u>saw</u>... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all.
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
Sadist!  I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline?  You're a monster.  That kid is going to be traumatized for...
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
I'll bet you're glad I waited until the last day to have this conversation.
Make it seem you have this comfortable, mysterious life and you don't give a shit whether she's a part of it. Oh, and bring up India, Talia has this obsession...  Whoa, Donald, play hard to get, not hard to want...Let Talia know that your goofy act is just something you do for the kids....
She's still pissed at me and took it out on you. We should have taken it slower. It's hard to operate in the woods. Much easier in, like a club.  Tell the girl you've got to go do something, leave her view, take way too long until she is worried that you're not coming back. Just as she starts feeling awful, you come up from behind and touch her neck...
There you are!  Man, I don't know how to thank...
No, they're not from Wendy.
Well, the first week of camp has swhooshed on by and I thought this a perfect time to finally pow-wow. I think we should discuss--
College was entertaining, Wichita, but after 40 days and 40 nights of this, I really think we're going to get to know each...
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
I have to get up. Still more to do. That boy hates Asian people. That girl thinks she gave her Mom cancer by dropping a plate on her hand. Her daddy touches her. His daddy never touches him. It would have been cooler if I'd died.
Oh you know, Bosnia, the importance of the right to vote...
Yeah. I guess I do.
We have more in common than you think, Wendy dear. I loved summer camp when I was young and I love it now. It's important. Between school, family, friends, pot, playstations, basic cable, and the goddamn Internet, it's possible to go your whole life without listening to your soul. Out here, in nature, away from the shit, surrounded by reminders of who I once was...I get recharged. Now who's the dork?
What else don't you believe in?
When were you in Niagara Falls?
Excuse me, Wichita, I can't seem to reach the top shelf in the storage room. Could you...
Have you ever thought of instead                            ] of making children more equipped                            ] for reality, we should make reality                         ] more equipped for children?                                 ]

Ronnie, I'm still a virgin.
If I got that money, I'd give it all to the poor. Every cent.
All right.
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?
Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.
Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
If you're going to openly be a bitch....
Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one would buy Crest.
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
Come on Heather. We want another look at today's lunch.
J.D.? You seem pretty amused. I thought you were giving up on high school guys.
Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
What's your damage? Brad says you're being a real cooze.
Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.
So tonight's the night. Are you two excited?
I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye Holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff. He doesn't realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you'll back off the cliff yourself.
Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.
That was seriously warped, Veronica.
It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius.
O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
Do you take German?
We're breaking up. I am out!
Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!
Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I love it. I usually go for whole sentences myself, but hey this is perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious...
Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.
If you'll excuse me......
The bomb, asshole!
You know what I want, babe?
Let's kick his ass.
Cool off, we're seniors.
Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...
You two....
Turn that back on!
Dear Veronica, Heather was your soulmate.....Share.
Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.
and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side.
waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern.

Come on, sit up.
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.
Look, Mother!
And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage!
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
Hello!
Oh-what a nice outfit!
But you're not fat, Mrs. Rieper!
She's terribly hurt . . .
To be known as He!
That.
John has fallen in love with me!
I think I'm going crazy.
Let's go overseas . . .
Just a couple more . . .
Poor Father . . .
Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.
Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
Sure plenty of times.
Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad.
I have my connections
Hello I'm Dr...
Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.
Now I want you to tell me what you remember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange. But this time I want you to make one small adjustment.
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
Get back here, junior bean counter. This is your supervisor speaking.
What's wrong, Trev?
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway?
OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!!  oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor, It's coming out.
You're alive...
Sorry to take up your time like that Trevor. Don't work too hard. Oh, before I forget. I talked your neighbor out of pressing charges.
And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.
But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it...
My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity.
... knock on my door, I'm a total insomniac.
-Tawny.
Hey. Can I borrow something?
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh?
That's for Ga... Ms. Gayley.
Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!
What's going on?  "Guilty"!  What is this?
Whaddaya mean they didn't reduce the bail?  If they didn't reduce it, how'dja spring me?
Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
Bernie, how'sa kid?
Willya lemme talk for Chrissake? I'm trying to tell you what happened.  What happened is...
"Elliot"?  The heroic goddamn fireman?
Listen, it's important, Ev, I gotta see him, I got my reasons, very goddamn important...
Turn that thing off.
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
Here.  Get off here.
Uh, er... I...
Uh, no.  But I, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and...
Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield...
Years?  There are going to be lots of... opportunities.
I... I know that, John...
You were... very... inspiring.
Now you help me up.  Boy, you seem...  taller.  It must be psychological...  now that I know you saved my life...
There, like that.  Kind of, uh, sexy.  You can support me anytime, John.
What're we talking about?  Reach out for what?
Ticket!  What's going on?
Upset!  What's he upset about?
Whaddaya mean what do I wanna know? I wanna know everything.  Who's this screwball LaPlante for Pete's sake, what the hell's he doing out there, auditioning for the priesthood? You're supposed to be on top of this, Gale, don't...  "Quit!"  You can't quit!  It's unprofessional!
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
Oh my God!  Bernie!
Hi, Chief.  You like the suicide?
I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.
Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.
They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
So, <u>Neil</u>.  How's it goin'?
Give it here, Bernard.
-- hospital.
Right.  So, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- I'm sure you'll be meeting some new people.
I guess so.  I mean, I know I'm responsible for my own actions. It was never because I was angry with anyone.  I didn't mean to hurt anyone ever.
And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?
The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
Oh no -- I mean, she's genuinely made me more fulfilled in many ways -- and I hope eventually to be able to teach her a few things, too.  What I mean is, I guess I'm still waiting for just that right -- synthesis between us -- where everything will be understood between us without even the need for words.
I can't help you if you don't help yourself.  It's really up to you. Brooding endlessly isn't going to help matters any.
Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
Well, can I make an appointment?
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
It's nice that you can make that choice.
Not me, I fell for it right down the line.  Be a good girl and believe all the fairy tales.  He married me because I was pretty.
I was thinking about our conversation the other day -- what you said about choices.
'"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
Baby, what is it?
It's the middle of the night, sweetie.
And?
Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?
Neil, you could have burned the house down!
Neil, calm down.
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
How were we -- were we cool?
Did you hear what he said?
-- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood.
I hear things in this house,
How long does it have to be a new house?
I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  It was <u>Monday</u>.  The day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?
The cab's waiting!
Did the cleaning woman come?
Honey, it's not the end of the world.  You'll call Lowenthal tomorrow and find out it was just a mix-up.  And if he's not interested anymore, then you'll find another company to go to maybe even your own.  You are free now, you are independent.
That's not the case.
What?
Oh God.
Should I come home when I'm finished there?
It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?
Just reduced.
How large is your brood?
It's fun.
What did the thermometer say?
You knew a second ago.  <u>Who</u> started it?
Even better.
That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.
Promise?
Really?
What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?
Hey, I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword.
Lieutenant Bedsoe?
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
You didn't see this.  Understand?
Tough.
You don't understand.  About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey.  A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley.  The fourth body we've never been able to identify.  All four men died from decapitation.  Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.
I'm gonna nail you, Nash.  That's a promise.
No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
Sing.
Life.  You've stopped living it.  You look, but you do not see.  You listen but, you do not hear.
The river.
Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.
Maybe myself.
France.
You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?
I stood up first.
What do you think?
Aye?
I cannot stay.
Do you love me, Conner?
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I was at the police station earlier today--
To talk to you.
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
Where did you get it?
Why do you stare at me like that?
I don't know.
I'm just trying to place you.
On the back it has--
It came from your great, great, great grandmother, Isabelle Tourez, who lived in Paris and died on the guillotine in 1789 -- alone -- and unmarried.  The ring was given to her by someone who loved her -- but knew that it could never be.
He's in there!
He's fine.  He swears he never left his post for a moment.  He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.
It has to be.
I am stronger than you, Highlander.
It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
It isn't over, is it, Conner?
I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
Don't cry, wee one.  It's a better place I go to.
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
This check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.
The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith.  They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas.
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.
What, he's cute?  That's his idea of humor?
<u>Get on the floor</u>!
Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
I have to tell you something --
That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting!
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.
Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
You're a funny guy, Talley.
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
We been through that.  Forget it.
Let me come get him.
We can take it with us.
What the fuck is that?
<u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay.
He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.
Want one?
What?
Kevin, my father needs a doctor.
What do you want?
How can we get out?
I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.
Smith!  Wake up!
I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.
What are you talking about, shot?  What happened?
Where are they?
That's not enough.
Chief?  Mike said a young girl answered the door.
Louise?
Louise?
Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.
She didn't answer.
Then get your men off the wall!  You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath!  I <u>know</u> this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him.
You want me to stick around, I could --
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau. Don't touch anything, just sit back and wait.
Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.
What's my name?
The kids are in here!
This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, son.
I've got the boy on the phone.  He's using a cell phone.  What was that, son?  I didn't hear you.
He has lots of disks.
That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
Who are you?
Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. Do you understand?
I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family.
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!
Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines.
We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
Have you requested re-enforcements?
They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
They fired a rocket at us.
What is it?
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
What do you mean, General?
When?
You know what the Scottish call it?
I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
We are better here.
You are a marked man.
I led no massacres.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
What do you mean George?
Satellite feed.
Here, have a sandwich.
Very soon.
Where are we going, sir?
The fog is too heavy, sir.
Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
Give her what she wants, room, food, anything. Charge it all. Don't you put her out, Paul.
Who did you call?
The commander is not here.
Excuse me.
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.
This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?
Let's have dinner first.
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.
Any luck?
Has Roger spoken yet?
This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they fled or could not make it home. There is hope.
Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers.
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
A car.
A Volkswagen.
I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
That is why they call it coach?
You have taken business class?
Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.
Twelve are dead.
Where has all our beer gone?
How much beer?
Paul, are you there?
The French. They supply the Rwandan army.
There are soldiers.
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
Mr. Price? Mrs. Price? Somebody? Hello??
Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago??
Even if I were inclined, I've had better -- and a lot safer -- opportunities to kill off a wife.
If there really is someone else in this house, I think the four of us can handle the situation.
Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.
Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.
What's down there?
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
This is nuts.
Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it.
Married. Once. Same woman. All these years. She just slithered up the stairs.
-- closed.
And you're not really as large and useless as you seem.
Thanks.
There's always exceptions.
What the hell good is fixing that gonna get us?
We can do it...
Cheery looking bunch.
Price!!
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
What?
...birds. Just seagulls or something walking on the glass, goddammit.
Don't touch me!
Could we have a word?
So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?
Jesus!
No...
Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
Sources have told this reporter that the real reason your Park's opening has been delayed was a near-fatal accident on one of the rides here. Comment?
Please! Something! Oh-God!
I'm ready now.
I think...I may have the answer.
-- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry.
I...don't think...anybody should be touching the body.
Fascinated.
Well, I don't.
Please! I need your help.
-- hey! Next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that!
Oh, no.
Don't know that it does.
Pritchett, what is this "core of darkness"?
-- hey! --
-- Eddie!!
Did you find something?
We don't have proof of that.
Are you all right?
It will heal.
Where does this amulet come from?
The dagger is used to free those possessed if stabbed directly into the heart, according to ancient beliefs -
Well then who did?!
It's going to hurt us!
My angel!
Oh my God, what happened to you? My baby -
Can I have this room daddy?
What's he doing daddy?
We're here Aubrey!  Look, don't be afraid.  We want you to come back to us...
I can't move!
Good night Angel...
Mommy!
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.
Well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't.  I'll have to call her.
It's just going to take a while.
To our family.
Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
God rest her soul.
Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape...
It doesn't matter to me.  What do you mean by that?
You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?
Maura!
What do you mean, unfortunately?
My name is Father Seamus.  I'm from Holy Rood church.
Well there's no time like the present.  Good night.
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
How long will it take!
Keep talking!
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
What, you think I'm kidding?  I guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys upstairs get hot.  Bingo, you're an anchor-woman.
It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right?
Something bad.
This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
Uh-huh?
Yeah.  Sure.  You mean ... tonight?
... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is.
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.
Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.
Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?
Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like all these people discovering who they used to be.  You know, like reincarnation?  It was really good.  You ever read that?
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
Terri?
What am I looking for?
You gonna buy?
That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway.
A dark star rising.  I was bound to another's system by a soul I once possessed.  A friend relieved me of that inconvenience.  Now I'm free.  Born again of Blood and Desire.
JP?
Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
That's terrible.  What a bitch.  She was obviously just using you, Terri.  Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore.
Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I are going to Rio.  We're hurt, we're tired, and a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich.  Right, buddy?...
That's your definition of "Hard?"
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
It's Captain Bob's steering wheel! Remember when the Captain.....
The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last time I played the game, Simpson only had a 40.
But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing?  Where's the want ads?  Gonna sell some spatulas.
Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.
The song's over!  Come on! "You could be swinging on a star."
Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain.  All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was "Who Shot J.R.?"
My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
Italy, France, Moscow.  They all just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do.  Man, Democracy isn't free elections. We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word "Fuck" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on "America's Funniest Home Videos."
This is the room above the Art Treasures room.  The lock is a Natalya Z-Z, first created...
Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically?
"Messed around" messed around?  I know-- I don't want to know.  First base?  Second Base?  Stop me when I'm getting warm...
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you?
As you know, the Da Vinci Codex, has lived in the Vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more.
Come on, this stuff will knock you out.  Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond.
Whoa.  Name's Hawkins, Eddie Hawkins. My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't call me Hudson, not even as a joke. The Nuns at St. Agnes called me that and they're the ones who helped make me what I am today. Not a compliment...
Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?
Oh, you read that.
Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
What have you been doing?
The C.I. what?  God, no...
Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...
Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously.
Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent.
I wanna know...
Cat got his tongue?
You're hitting Rutherford's Auction House.  Easy as my brother's wife.  Directions are in the bag.  Just open the seventh floor safe and take out the thingie...
No, let me!
For those kind of wages, I could have built the factory in America! They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide!  Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk! The Hawkster!  What do you think of the vehicle?
So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words...
I'll torture you so slowly you'll think it's a career!  I'll kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to the Prom!
What a pleasant surprise.  You're probably wondering...
Remember that shoe you lost...
Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.
You killed a friend.  Why should I help you go for the gold?
Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?
Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.
If you do anything to my friend...
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy.
...Hello?
And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine --
About seven minutes.
The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --
Confused?
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
Oh yes! In Muncie!
...The people look like ants.
Your i --
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...
Hey! Where's that martini?!
I tell ya the guy's a phony.
Muncie.
I want a martini! It's New Year's Eve and I want a Martini!
Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.
What the heck's she doin', Lou?
...Geez.
...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
...say, the hula hoop such a success.
I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!
I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
...It is?
But, Buzz, you know I never --
Oh, geez.
Yessir.
'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I -- '
Well, frankly, I...
You, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- scratch that; I'll fire him.  ...Make it fast, make it fast.
At the Muncie College of Business Administration.
Not even behind your back?
But --
Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --
...Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours.
She finds him.
He don't look wise.
She's got other problems, of course...
...adenoids.
No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.
Some of this native nonsense. The Houngan has his prescription and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.
Mrs. Rand.
Mrs. Rand...
I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.
The West Indies?
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.
Don't let it bother you so, Wes.
That doesn't sound like him.
I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
Why was the maid crying?
A figure of St. Sebastian.
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
I've never given it much thought.
I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
And what happened then, Mrs. Rand?
Ah -- that's where reason took hold.
Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons.
But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.
What about her?
That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.
We're all in it.  There won't be a shred of pride or decency left for any of use.  Say something, Paul!  You've always been good with words.  Put some together, now, and tell us that you're not responsible -- that every damnable bit of it doesn't rest squarely on your shoulders!
That isn't true.  You never understood her.
Right o'.
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --
Yeah, that one.
You've...
That this was going to be a key party?
Well?
You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch --
I'll drive you --
Do you think? Maybe we should call someone --
Hi dad.
Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
About?
Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.
How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --
Dad stop it!
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
Look, kiddo, don't worry about it. I really don't care that much. I'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all.
He's probably been waiting all night at the station.
But...
It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties.
What?
Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
You okay?
You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room.
Mikey Williams?
Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.
Oh.
Thanks again. For the dinner.
I used to know how to cook.
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
Forget what?
You ask what the point is?
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
I'm afraid she's something of a gossip, isn't she?
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.
Flame on, asshole.
What?
Shit. You're not planning --
Awesome sleet and rain.
Jesus, Jim!
Would it matter?  And what's that?
Maybe you should have just a half.
Yeah but you don't even know me really.
I'm in love with Libbets Casey.
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
You have to follow me?
How are the parental units functioning these days?
Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night.
Right.
Hey Wendy.
Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?
Nice kid.
So far.
My partner...
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
Who's playing?
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through.
No.
No.
What happened at that signing?
Eight years.
He knew exactly what we'd be looking for. Made sure to cover up all his tracks.
What do you want to talk about?
We'll talk when we get back to Seattle.
Your friend's all business.
Since grade school.
You and Kay were like sisters?
She used some stupid code name.
Down at the station?
She was only seventeen.
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
Where's your back-up?
Wild card.
Disappointing, isn't it? To come so far and find so little. Jaded ingenues, amusing themselves with make- believe...
So you have the answers...
Who made us what we are?
And perhaps this is the only real evil left...
You would never give up life. If the world were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and study it. You see too clearly. You see too much.
And the vampires of the Theatre?
Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.
Why always on this night?
And if I cut my hair again?
What plans?
Stop pestering me then!
But you never let me see you kill, Louis.
Claudia! You did that?
You see the old woman? That will never happen to you. You'll never grow old. You will never die.
Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.
What was that?
The ship is sailing wihout us!
You don't remember? Or you never knew.
I lothe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them!
Do you think I would let them harm you?
He can protect us, Claudia.
Oh God! I love you still, that's the torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis...
She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember.
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?
You've just done it -
Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
Did I hear a yes?
Yes, that's you, my handsome friend. And you'll look that way till the stars fall from heaven.
You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.
I know. It gets cold so fast.
Have you ever been caught?
I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.
Unless I make her one of us...
Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. You don't want it to go on.
Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
I didn't want to kill her.
You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again.
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
So you want me to tell you the story of my life...
See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it?
Well, what a lucky break for me.
You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
How did you do that?
You said the slave had a crucifix...
You can't look at them...
You found nothing?
No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!
You promise to care for her then?
Yes.
What can I do for you?
You're in 201 and 202.
Julie, we're talkin' suites!  That'll be just fine with us.
Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.
Sorry. Emergencies only.
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.
That could break the machine.
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
He does work hard.
Remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' I do for a weekend once every ten years.
Their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.
Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute --
No way.
You get any sleep at all?
It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.
What do you mean?
I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.
Julie?
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her.
Never do that again.
You've got all these theories but where is he? Where? Where's your fisherman killer?
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?
Deep breaths --
No, no, no. This was really sweet...
There was a body! I swear it!
...Why?
If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.
Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
Something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining.
Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
Well, I'm in school and --
Jeez, that's a full carat --
They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.
Where'd Estes go?
He complained of not feeling well. I thought he was drunk 	he staggered.
I wonder if my editor's psychic? Reports from the Greek front are going to be a little vague.
It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
You're just talking nonsense.
I suppose you want to hear my prayer to Hermes.
Good night, Oliver.
Where's Thea?
Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth --
If Mr. Albrecht is right, we'll all be free in a few days.  I suppose you'll be going on to Athens?
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
It's getting dark. I can't leave now.
I felt he did not like me.
I wish I didn't have such bitter knowledge of you, Cathy.
Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life you've ruined mine 
You've been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man   working at him   turning him against Thea.
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.
No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
This girl --
Why not Take the doctor's advice? You're the hero of the battle of Corphon.
I know all you are going to say -I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -there is something about her the way she moves  the way she turns her head.
I've seen men die drunk - and I've seen men die of the plague.
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
Thea is so like her  in every feature 
What's bothering you, Thea? Is it the General?
Why in the world can't you?
I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
Thea, what is this? What are you trying to tell me? "He stole your mother" -
Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.
Get that ladder up here.
George . . .
All right, put up your hands. No fast movesme on out here, both of you.
Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen!  It's that fellow there  he says he's an angel  he's tried to hypnotize me.
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.
I told you  I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
You have no car.
No.
You know where he lives?
Where's Mary?
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?
I know. I know. He didn't go.
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
What's that?
Hey, Ernie!
Hello, Joseph, trouble?
Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it.
Well, sure I do.
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.
So long, George. See you in the funny papers.
What boat you sailing on?
He's gone. Don't worry. His name is Welch. He don't come in to my place no more.
Uh-huh.
That does it! Out you two pixies go, through the door or out the window!
Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't it?
I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
Well, no younger than I was.
I'm going to miss old Annie. Pop, I think I'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party.
Got a match?
Where are you going?
Say hello to New York for me.
Old Building and Loan pal, huh . . .
Why didn't you call me?
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
Yes, hello? George . . . it's Potter.
Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?
Well, hello.
Hot dog! Just like an organ.
Do I look as funny as you do?
Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
Uh-huh.
If I told you it might not come true.
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here.
Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.
After that, who cares?
George Bailey lassos stork.
You forgot something.
Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
I can't wait to get there.
Oh, shit.
It's okay, it's okay....
Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!
Maybe by now they are.
They're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups.
Over here.  I want you to meet somebody.
Why'd they decide to move?
We're carrying weight.
Loser sails home alone.
We're hung up here.  Snagged.
Tina!
Good morning!
On your own time?
Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
About 10 degrees off your star- board bow, take a heading leeward of Sand Island, and lay her north by northeast....
Where to?
Bartending?  I'm 17.
Don't go out if it's rough or any- thing, huh?  We've had a lot of trouble.
You stay here a minute.
Michael.
Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....
Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
Wait a minute....
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
The what?
Carcharadon Carcharias.
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Mmmm.
Mrs. Silvera?
Hey!  That's my boss!
Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up?
One what?  Ah-ha!
Thank you.  I'll tell him.
What's wrong?
What?
They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
What're you going to do today?
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.
Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something?
Did he raise the Kids?
Yeah?  Then what?
Can I go swimming?
Some people.
They made me go with them.
What's wrong?
My cousin will be here tomorrow.
Take a break for a minute, okay?
Eddie, can we do that?  Can we go skiing?  We can use my Uncle's boat.  Eddie?
Come on back up here!
You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?
What about sailing?
Mmmmmm.
Be careful....
How much longer?
I'd like to go out to the light- house with you.
I thought you were grounded.
That's fun!  Let's race for some- thing!
What's wrong?
Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone!
He's got to help or it won't work.
They're turning around.
I want to go with you!
Michael....
Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home.
Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else.
We're ready for you.
Why don't you take a rest, Brian?
Go on, you're tired.
Go on, Doctor.
Absolutely.  Good idea.
I'll need more men to look.
You see the three-quarter socket?
Never know down there.  Helps to have a friend, sometimes.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Not enough loving.
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
And leave me down here???
Don't think about it.  It's over.
Change your mind?
Come on.
What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?
How is he?
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
I am.  You're not.
Go where?
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.
I told you, something's upset them.
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
You look like an orange worm.
Why?
I insist you get rid of that bomb.
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
Sharks have to keep moving.  They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die.
He's big as a bloody bus!
A piece of pie on Sunday.
He's a young one.
Sean.  Sean, where are you?
Well, I needed a cold shower.
Let's go, let's go!
The space shuttle has landed!
Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!
Ahhh, ahhh...
Gotta sneeze.
Bring the crane over.  Come down. Easy down.
Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
Make sure you put this back.
Watch it, Brody.  You're ruining the shot.
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
In a restaurant.  You sit there and they swim around you.
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
Took it this morning.
How is he?  Still fighting crime?
Come on, let's go.
She still talking to you?
You want to show this?
It has its virtues.  It hasn't fallen down yet....
Come on, sweetheart....
It sure is good to be home....
It doesn't take much to remember what day they come....
Turn it off....
Sweetheart....
Where is she?
Why didn't you tell us?  Why didn't you tell us?
No cooking while you're here...No washing dishes...No cleaning....
It'll grow on you.
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
You want to try your hand at something...?
At least he doesn't have a beard....
All he did was kiss me....
Beginning of what?
Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
Get the bang sticks.  We're going down.
We don't want any....
Ask the big doctor about his work.  Tough life you Bahamian beach bum... Playing in the water all day....
In a minute....
No one.  Nothing.  We've got to get this finished before the tide comes in.
What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?
I'll be in to read you a story.
I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma.
Oh, it looks like my uncle's.  He taught me how to sail when I was a kid....
All you all right?
You could teach...You could....
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
You hungry?
We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael....
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....
It was no accident....
What are you doing?
How do you like flying?
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
I'll nick the boss' plane again....
I have this overwhelming desire to kiss you, Ellen Brody.
They had them on the big one....
Hurry!
Can you keep a secret?  Something no one else knows?
I hope she's a good sailor....
Grab your socks....
Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy....
What say we get the hell out of here, Ellen Brody. ...
What happened?
Matt?
Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....
How many...?
We're being paid to see where they go...How they propagate....
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
I stuck them on, man....
Maybe I missed you too....
Bad boy....
Sharp shirt, Jake....
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....
What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?
We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.
I don't remember.  One day he was just here....
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them.  You hearing anything?
You getting a reading on them?
How come only me?
Stop that!
Holy Christ....
Your equipment has crapped out again....
Don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....
That bad, huh?
You have the safety talk at school, one o'clock tomorrow....
Did you like that, Mama?
I'm glad of it. I'd rather please you than anybody I know of. Oh, darlin', will you give me something?
You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut 'em for little Jakie. Ha. I'm gonna steal something.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if I don't. Mama, darlin', if I'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. Oh yes, we're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. There's the Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs. Oh, a whole lotta Bergs; I don't know 'em all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, Mama. You see Mrs. Friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist."
So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing?
What do you think?
Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..
Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
That isn't what you said before.
You believe me, don't you?
God, it pisses me off, Ross.
Stop it.
Well .. I didn't know that ..
What about Citrine?
Now?
What if we need a back up?
What is that?
What do you want me to do, Chief?
You're pushing this too hard. It's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?
Then <u>where's the body</u>? .. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
She's <u>not</u> "missing." Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? <u>No</u>. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John.
Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.
Vehicle references.
You don't know what you done, Taylor.
You must have some idea about him.
I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had?
Oh.
I don't know, I haven't read much. I don't think poetry's my kinda thing?
She runs a kind of hair dress- ing and you know, beauty salon ..
I have to talk to you, Helena.
You're looking worried again, Helena?
You do?
And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
When did John divorce?
You think he still loves her?
I haven't worn heels since I was 16. I don't think I could walk in these?
You think John would like it?
He's happy, darlin ..
Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.
Shut up, King Jay ..
Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got?
I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir
The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
Don't ever stop fucking me!
You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
This can't be happening to me.
Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.
Didn't hear it.
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
Oh no.
Oh tsht. Yes.
And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --
No, that's fine.  What calls came in today?
... light.
It's all going to work.
It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Hey you.
Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
Another time, okay Dorothy?
Why do you love me?
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.
This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room.  Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you.  I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you.  I missed my wife.  We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh --  I love you.  You complete me.
What about medical?
No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.
Denver is where he should be.
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign.  Because I'm still sort of moved by your "my word is stronger'n oak" thing --
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
Good.  I was just testing ya.  But just you saying that? Makes me love ya.
Rod --
See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
You are not allowed to act this way.
Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
What's wrong.
Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother.
You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
The kid is amazing.
We can still take the offer, Rod.
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
You don't want to go home, do you?
I'm asking you a question --
I think so.
Thanks for coming.
Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife?
How can I make your life better?
You gonna get that --
I'll go back to them.
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
Pardon me?
Jerry --
SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be?  You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.  You'd be my only client on that team...
Let's go the zoo.
Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.
I won't tell.
I don't see any.
He should have kept his head tucked down.
...once-in-a-lifetime.
Young adult.
That's him. Thats Eric!
Eric! Are you here?
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
Well what?
I don't know. I don't have it with me.
Sweetheart, you're okay.  You're okay.  You're okay.
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
He could have died.
You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
Where's Dad?
How was your trip? Profitable?
Is it a rex?
ALAN!
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
Hmm?
So, Mark's working at the State Department now.
I'd better get going.
When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.
Eric, your parents are both here.
They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
Found this, but the battery's dead.
Know what this is?
How much of this island have you explored?
See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?
How do you mean?
Sorry.  We were saying?
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
No, no, no, no, no, no . . .
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
Well, is he?
Where's the power and radio setup?
We took to the rock.
If I don't move, I can't shoot it.
You version of it.
You know how to work a radio, don't you?
No way.
No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
Because it exists.
Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived.  And the second greatest predator must take him down.
No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact.
Can you set up?
That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
That little black line?
Where's Kelly?
We're talking, my dear, about a calculated risk, which is the only option left to us.  We will never find the command NEDRY used.  He covered his tracks far too well, and I think it's obvious he's not coming back.  So shutting down the system - -
How long will this take?
Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?
Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.
Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
Alan, these aren't bones anymore.
This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.
But you know, I should  really be the one going .
The taphonomy sure looks that way.
A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
The what?
Okay, who's the jerk?
Oh, shit.
Are you sure?
Ellie, com one!!
Dr. Grant!
What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
Okay, I'm on channel two.
Alan, listen to this.
Dino droppings?
Yes?
Up and down, up and down!
Hey!  Where did you find those things?
Are they heavy?
The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?
Have a heart gentlemen.  Their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion.
I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!
Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
So am I going to help you with your foot?
You know what this is?  It's a dinosaur egg.  The dinosaurs are breeding.
Cloning from What?!  Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand!
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
You're married?
I didn't say you were scared.
What?  What can we do?
Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?
Well, it's - - right up your alley.  Look, why don't you both  come on down for the weekend.  Love to have the opinion of a paleobotoanist as well.  I've got a jet standing by at Choteau. 
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
Tim!  Lex!
It's safe.
Tim, Tim, Tim....
What are you gonna do now if you don't have to dig of dinosaur bones any more?
Watch how it eats!
C'mon Tim, move down, damn it!
Your silence intrigues me.
I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
Why didn't I build in Orlando?
We miss you.
What's going to happen to the goat?  He's going to eat the goat?!
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sorry - -
Hello?
Mister Biller?
I don't know...
I can't wait to hear your opening argument.	"Ladies and Gentlemen	of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."
And this hand... it... it slashed Doctor Layton's throat... and the Deputy. Then it grabbed Danny by the head...  And it pulled his head right down into his chest... I couldn't... Hayes lays a hand his shoulder.
Sorry.
So... why can't Jason get a fair trial?
He wets the bed?
Nurses. That's why I went into medicine.
What are you doing?
Where's he going?
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.
Ten minutes...
We're down to seven minutes.
You work in the insurance department?
You look like brothers.
Heralds of a new age -- does that sound immodest?
-- Merely in the interests of order.
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
Will you do me a favor then?
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
A true friend would do it.
Did you see him?
But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.
Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
To do my work well, I have little time for --
I did not realize it was obligatory.
-- Eduard --
I understand you fancy yourself an author.
The <u>Orlac</u> claim.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
They're not obliged to tell.
Gabriela! -- you did get away.
Gabriela ...?
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
Was he depressed?
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
Why are you so aggressively unimaginative?  Eduard is no longer the only casualty.
-- You seem amused.
-- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency.
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
Wait a minute.  "Raban?"  Where have I heard that name?
What's the matter?
If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees?
I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
What if I petitioned one of the Directors?
Where do our records go to in the Castle?
I want to thank you.
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
Give it back!
Barricade the gates! Quick!
Look, I've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there's no island like that around here.
They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.
Listen buddy! Cut the crap! We're looking for Ann, not making a Goddamn movie!
Holy shit! Look at the size of that!
Set up the camera boys! Get a shot of me comin' ashore!
Did you fear for your life?
Why?
Honey, a couple of years ago, with Jane and Frankie? -- Jane sent me a Dumper --
Enjoy.  Well --
Sure dear, yes.
-- May I? It's so --
All right. Loneliness.  Well -- separated. From other people. Forgotten.  Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the motions, right? But the truth is, I don't belong.
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
You have no idea what I'm talking about.
You said that.
Gee.
You remind me of my uncle.
Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?
Well do you think it was him?
Did you like my friend Frankie?
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
What're you gonna do next?
You said it was!
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
What's the matter?
The same as Jane McKenna.
The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.
Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam?
Where'd you spend last night?
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything. It was just -- you know, everything all of a --
I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.
Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away?
You wanted to, or you are?
What?
Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time.
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them?  Peace in the family.  Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.
Town Police.
No.
But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann?
He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything.
Think this is our guy?
The subject got emotionallv disturbed; he just dropped out. There's thousands.
Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case --
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
I'm Dr. Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked me to look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet.
What does?
What do you have here, Billy?
No.  But I've been to Brooklyn.
That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.
What do you like best about her?
What do you like best about your daddy?
He hits me on the planet Kriptarium, when I steal the buried treasure from the famous peanut butter factory.
Greatest.
When is mommy coming back?
What if she forgets?
You're late.
I'm sorry.
Then eat around it.
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
Owwww...You're hurting me... You're hurting me...I hate you ...I hate you...
I'm sorry...
Daddy?
Is mom ever coming back?
Billy.   This is Dr. Alvarez. She would like to talk to you.
Are you going to get remarried?
Your mom.
Objection!
Objection!  I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.
Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?
Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?
Yes...Look, during the last five years we were married, I had...I was getting more and more...unhappy, more and more frustrated.  I needed to talk to somebody.  I needed to find out if it was me, if I was going crazy or what.  But every time I turned to Ted--my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it.  He became very...I don't know, very threatened.  I mean, when- ever I would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack.  Anyway, we became more and more separate ...more and more isolated from one another.  Finally, I had no other choice, I had to leave. And because of my ex-husband's attitude--his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, I had come to have almost no self- esteem...  At the time I left, I sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me--that my son would be better off without me.  It was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to realize I wasn't a terrible person.  And that just because I needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother.
Objection!
No further questions.  Thank you Mrs. Phillips.
Objection!  Your honor, counsel is raising a question that is not germane to these proceedings.
And did you have a close personal relationship?
I consider it less my failure than his.
I thought you might just like to know that at five-fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the Fire and Ice account by Revlon.
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
Look, it's not your fault, okay? It's me.  It's my fault--you just married the wrong person.
I'm not taking him with me.
Ted, listen to me...You and I, we had a really crappy marriage--  Look, don't get so defensive, okay?  It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up--
Ted, when we got married it was because I was twenty-seven years old and I thought I should get married and...when I had Billy it was because I thought I should have a baby...and I guess all I did was mess up my life and your life and--
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
Jesus Christ.  That's a real blockbuster.  I always figured you guys had it made.
But...just in case...I mean, just on the off chance she doesn't. What are you going to do about the kid?
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--
Hiya, Phyllis.  These are the Revlon contracts.  I thought you ought to check them out.
You want to know why?  I'll tell you why...  Another scotch and soda for the gentleman.  I'll tell you exactly why. Because you're not his buddy anymore.  Because he can't count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him.
You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.
It's a very good job--too good to pass up.  I'll be handling funding for the whole...  Look, I...  ..."like" you a lot.  And you...  ..."like" me, okay?  Maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different...
Three months.  How can you tell?
Look, Ted, I don't honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was planning on kidnapping him.
Oh, Christ!
Mrs. Phillips, how long have you known Ted Kramer?
Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
Now, I'd advise you to wait outside.  It'll be eas--
All right, Thelma, you want to know what's going on?  I'll tell you what's going on.  I'll tell you exactly what's going on.
Then how come she never said anything like that to me?
What are you going to do?
You're on your own, understand?
You ever think about getting married again?
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
We must go, Holiness.
Please, come, Holiness.
You were a beautiful baby. So calm.
I am sorry, Lhamo.
No.
I will buy them for you.
Goodbye, Kundun.
Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
Dalai Lama.
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.
Oh, no. Where will he go?
Your father had been very sick.
Cow.
Me. First break of day.
You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered.
I will be back in a few days.
May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
Where is Alsace?
Britain chooses not to.
Has anyone died?
One country did sponsor the resolution. A land called "El Salvador".
Your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in Lhasa.
I am scared.
I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao. I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay.
This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died, my mother was so sad. A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born.
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
What do you think?
I have more men.
She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
This is Britain.
This is Tibet. And this is China.
You will not come?
Did you love your husband, before you married?
Hmm.
You can't take a cow by eminent domain.
Why are we landing?
--<u>Who</u> <u>is</u> <u>he</u>?
Keystone what?
I do <u>not</u> like you.
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?
This is a setback.
Promise you won't kill me, first.
Where is he?!
He never said "go".
Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
And again.  How would you get him on land?
Such the flirt.
<u>Jack</u>!
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
And how would we neutralize him?
I'm okay.
You're gonna be okay.
Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a <u>small</u> point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by <u>him</u>, but you seemed quick to join in.
How big do the bears get?
The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--
I'm not making it up.
You flew up here because your boss--
Okay.  We're up at six.
He thinks they're what?
They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.
<u>Are</u> you okay?
Why he's that <u>big</u>, I don't know. Why he's <u>here</u>... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving.  Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.
Sorry.
Who taught you be be a nurse?
We might as well pack.
Are we crazy?
He's mooing.
We gotta get to Hector!!
You sure?  I don't mind...
No.
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
Thanks for your help.
This is a little different.
You're sort of a rude person.
What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?
He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
What was that?
They're coming right in.
That's not what you came to say.
Hey.
This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
<u>You</u>?
You and Kevin.
"- every day."
Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient...
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
Do you need a police escort, Starling? Or do you think you can find the airport by yourself?
Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
Okay, Starling. Let's have it.
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
Are you finished?
What do you see, Starling?
He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.
What would it take?
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
Sir, that's great news. But how -
Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
And the questionnaire...?
No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.
Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.
And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?
Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him, too.
I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us.
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.
A moth... How did you predict that?
The death of my father.
Two months.
I - ran away...
On what basis would they reject him?
I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.
Then tell me how.
He kills w-
No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?
I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ?
What did you do?
I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. Be sure you extend me the same courtesy.
Examination and interview materials are confidential. We've never violated an applicant's trust, and we never will.
Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, she was just ID'd. I met her on a slab in West Virginia. And sometime tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin.
Your West Virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble, but I finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy - studying the skin.
My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
Will you go back to England?
You do not know what you are saying!
My God, Alice.
I see...
Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!
Head for... for the white water.
Then what?
And if we're unlucky?
Any powder?
You do what you want with your own scalp.  Do not be tellin' us what to do with ours.
I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over us is tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.  No force on earth will keep me here... Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each man make your own decision... Those who are goin', be back here in an hour.
So the Huron are the servants of the French?  To do what the French are shamed to do?
Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
Many men here, their homes are in the path.
I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way.
Advance, Sergeant Major!
Shoulder arms!  Present! 
Sergeant Major!
We must... stop... soon. Women are... tired.  You... understand?
No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
Three, four oxen... much wampum.
What is enough?
Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.  It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be buried.
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
My colors?
Le mot d'ordre?
The mask is because you think it might be...catching?
That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
DeJesus!  A readout!
Bullshit...I was just talking to him.  I saw him move.
No way...
Look at my foot, sir!  This bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk!
That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
Sixpack?
They know, don't they?
We made it!
What's wrong with it?
Excuse me, sir...
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
Thank you, Martin.
But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!
Hey, Bo...when're you going to be off that thing?  I want to find out tonight's NBA scores and check the weather.
Yes sir...
Bullshit.
C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...
What is it?
What's wrong?
What's wrong, did you miss me?
I'll kill him!
How much did you part with?
Because it's cheap like a budgie.
Yes?
Bacon, see what we got.
Like what?
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
I think I can help you, as it happens.
The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
Have you counted the money?
Mind your language in front of my boy.
Son, have a look in his locker.
Hello, John. Nice holiday?
Son?
How long has he been in there, son?
It's not him, Dad.
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?
Is that you, Dean?
Jesus, I have heard about him.
We gotta get those guns.
So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
So do you know these geezers well?
There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.

What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?
Yeah, one of them's out.
Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
What was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what?
Well, what's going on?
Who's this fat man, then?
You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.
Tom, this is our case.
You got it all?
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
Yes?
Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.
How much did you say it was, Tom?
Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
How many feet?
The money, the gear!
You jerk--
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
That makes it okay?
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
Who's "they"?
Why do you think they let us in on the "deal"?
Sam the Man.
How's business?
I hear they're closing that post down.
Charley Wade.
It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up.
You still going to all the home games?
Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
350 pounds.
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
You'll get official notification when I make my decision. He is out the door--Otis pulls himself a beer as Carolyn steps back out--
I'm a colonel.
Same as they done in Mexico.
My father says the day you're  born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own.
Otis Payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life.
Are we going to ever see your father?
Recycling, right? We invented that. The government doesn't have to tell people to do it.
Fifteen years in El Paso.
Bird flying south-you think he sees that line? Rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different. So why should a man?
Right.
Cliff--
The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything,
Mikey--
He'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he's stabilized--
Black Seminoles?
This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
So.
I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
Reputation?
Es muy lindo, su coche--
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here?
This girl is a friend of yours?
"Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, "What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!"
Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man.
Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected.
Tell that one, Hollis--
Charley Wade were known to have put a good number of people in the ground, and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball with him.
That's a matter of interpretation--
Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime--
When we backed you--
I heard there was a bit of a fuss.
There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body?
We're building up tourism, Sam--
Sam--
I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel to kill that story.
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.
Why would I want to go there?
Mrs. Bledsoe?
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
And my father?
You got in late last night.
Time marches on.
Three months.
Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
I mean what did we know about anything?
It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--
You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other?
I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
You think we need a new jail?
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
If he hadn't found that Deputy job, I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble. Settled him right down. That and your mother. 'Course he had that other one later.
He doesn't need to know all my business.
Billy?  This was on Miller's forehead.  Any idea what it is?
That's Butterfield...
How'd you spell that again?
We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.
Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free.
Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm.
What's the connection?
He's a secretive man.
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
You don't believe me.
How did it go today?
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
What did you find?
He taught all this to Swann?
What then?
It's okay.
Harry?
What the fuck?
Valentin?
... they believe you.
Sure.
What were you doing up there?
Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
Trickery and divinity.
No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
Then what do you want?
Philip Swann?
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
Any movie stars buried here?
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
I can't let you in.
Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
She has no real grip on reality.
My God.
Hold on.
Are they all in the business?
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.
So Nix won't come looking for her?
Oh Jeez.
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
Did she know where Nix was buried?
Nobody's better off this wav!
That's where we're all going.
Can you do it?
Call me tomorrow.
Why's that?
I've got so much power to give you, Swann.  All you have to do is...beg.
You could still help me do that.
You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
Yeah, they told me.
Try twenty-five.
Oh, hi.
Not really. How long are you here for?
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
You really are having a mid-life crisis.
What do you feel like singing, Bob?
Of course.
Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.
Hey look, it's Sausalito.
Why do they switch the r's and l's here?
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
But, I'm mean.
You made it.
What happened to your toe?
Do you know where we are?
So, where'd you go today.
When are you leaving?
Do you like massage?
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
I don't know.
Like Japanese food.
It's ok.
Ok.
I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink downstairs. She wants to talk about some photo thing.
You wanna come?
Like popcorn?
Yeah.
Will you please stop smoking?
Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later.
John! What are you doing here?
Uh..thanks.
How'd your interview go?  I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
Yeah, like...
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
Seemed...on edge.
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
I can take care of myself.
When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
Your court order, Dr. Allen.
It's the patient's request, doctor.
Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room?
I don't mean to belittle you, but we've been through this before.  Satan is not what you think he is.  Satan is not some creature.
Why are you doing this to me?
Father, please don't die.
Yes... and you are?
A narcissist doesn't admit it.  It's the extreme of self-denial.
What's that got to do with you?
What do you mean?
Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
Why did he try to kill me?
What?!?!
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
You should think about getting professional help.
I don't understand what's going on.
So what?
Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted.  Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was.  Peter...I'm sorry.
We needed to know all we could.
Nothing yet.
Get up!!
Hang on, get it up, go on, higher.
He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born?
What do you mean?
What about after?
Plenty of time.
What can I do?
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
Good seeing you again.
You don't want to face it.
I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.
Yeah.
What do you mean by that?
Seems George isn't making too many friends in lockup.
Thanks for handling this.
She came to me with a wild story about demonic possession.
Monica, what did you do?
Ah, Mom.
I hate it.
Taste this.
That's not it.
...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour.
You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold.
...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.
I can take it.
I'm an English major.  You like English?
You could make a career by telling me where.
I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
No.
This brother from my college.
You do.
I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
Coach hates me, doesn't she?
But?
What's that?
Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.
I never knew a girl that could play.
I don't know.  A lot.
You do act different.
How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
I think we gotta kiss now.
Way to hoop.
So she's honest.
I'm not the one who put this scar here.
You don't look half-bad.
When'd you get this?
I can't help girls coming up to me.
It's okay, little baby.
Who's nobody?
So that's it, just forget about us?
Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.
So, how's pro-ball, Europe?
You visiting?
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
You're serious.
You asked me what was missing.
You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't.
With who?
What?
What is this?
Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
Still the man.
Later when?
Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
Why not?
What people?
Still is, so let yourself out.
Lucky kid.
And some things should never fucking happen!
What do you want?
Look, I'm busy.
I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
It's been the same fuckin' thing for thirty years, Burt --
C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up --
Call 911. Call 911 right now.
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
Hello?
Hi, hello, great.  This is Seduce and Destroy?
Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?
My mother had breast cancer.
Oh, she's fine.
It was scary though.
I don't wanna talk to you.
Honey.
uh...uh...What is it?
OPEN THE DOOR.
For what?
No.
ok.
About two years ago.
I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --
Yeah.
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
Just Jim.
Bye, bye, Claudia.
Eight o'clock?
Why not?
And I bet you say that to all the girls --
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
Wow....huh..."...piss and shit..."
I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot of people.  I wanted to tell you that. I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me.
I'm sorry --
I haven't been on a date since I was married and that was three years ago....and Claudia...whatever you wanna tell me, whatever you think might scare me, won't...and I will listen...I will be a good listener to you if that's what you want...and you know, you know...I won't judge you.... I can do that sometimes, I know, but I won't...I can...listen to you and you shouldn't be scared of scaring me off or anything that you might think I'll think or on and on and just say it and I'll listen to you....
Say what you want and you'll see --
Let me go, leave me, let me go, it's ok, please.
Diet Coke.
Where's Richard and Julia?
Where's the news department at this studio?
What?
Not enough, what do you want?
What do you mean, "like what?" -- you could get endorsments and shit --
Richard, shut it and keep it down.
DADDY! DAD! DAD WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN' ON?
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GET HIS MONEY AND GO -- DID YOU GET HIS MONEY? DID YOU GET IT?  DID YOU GET HIS MONEY, DAD?
C'mon, Dad.  We gotta just GET HIS MONEY AND GO, LET'S GO. Let's get the money --
Ok. Listen. You: c'mere.
Presence - with a double ass meaning gifts I bestow, with my riff, and my flow but you don't hear me though think fast, catch me, yo cause I throw what I know with a Resonance - fo'yo'trouble-ass fiend in weenin yo-self off the back of the shelf Jackass crackas, bodystackas dicktootin niggas, masturbatin' yo trigga butcha y'all just fake-ass niggas --
I'm almost done.
I'm walking towards the elevator's, Janet.
What happend?
Just throw some money around. Money, money, money.
No.  I mean, I'm telling you: I'm telling you that I have love.
This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.
You see?
I'm sick and I'm in love.
Brad, I know you don't love me now --
...please...
This is so fucked, Solomon. I don't deserve this.
I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --
You don't need braces.
I don't know.
-- he's fucking dying, he's dying as we're sitting here and there isn't a fucking thing -- jesus, how can you tell me to calm down?
Yeah.
This is the number for Hospice. Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --
Get a girlfriend.
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?
...cocksucker....
No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
-- just to clarify --
Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
And what did your parents do?
Are you close?
And your father?
I'm sorry.
I wouldn'tve asked --
And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
Where does that name come from?
It's not your given name, right?
And "Frank?"
Kind of.
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
So....Phil....um...I think I'm gonna step in and try and see him and say something if he can...talk...I mean:
You can't just come in here.
You're just come in --
I didn't do anything.
You just woke up.  And what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks?
--- What was that?
This is the LAPD, if anyone is in the closet I want you to come out and show yourself to me, slowly and with your hands up --
Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
You look great.
Yeah. Yes.
What happend to you?
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
I'm gonna need a full name, Stanley.
Slowly or quickly?
Did you tell her?
hey.
No.
Two years...three years...
Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?
I think that you know.
But you can't say....
Yes you do.
Want me to wake her up?
I'm sorry.
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
We're not going out two days before we set the record, it's not gonna happen.
They look pretty smart, I think.
You have to go, Stanley.  You're the smartest.
Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
What does that mean?
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
listen...listen to me now, Phil: I'm sorry, sorry I slapped your face. ...because I don't know what I'm doing... ...I don't know how to do this, y'know? You understand?  y'know?  I...I'm...I do things and I fuck up and I fucked up....forgive me, ok? Can you just...
You been on Prozac long?  Dexadrine?
Pink Dot.
What would you like?
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
Let's go,let's go, let's go, you shoulda done that ten minutes ago --
Why didn't you answer those questions?
I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.
You're two fuckin' days from the record, get through this and I'II do anything for you, you just gotta get through this --
I think that you have to be nicer to me.
Hi.
You know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, Stanley....  I'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don't, I come home without the money....
I'm sorry to put all this on you, Stanley --
What is that?
M'lady...?
I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
It can.  I know the way.
Who is he, Aramis?
How is he?
You can do it.
Aramis, this will never --
I have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not a priest, I could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone.
Pull them back!
Where are we?
It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.
And why are you so glum?
The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!
Coming?
D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.
D'Artagnan, unready?
"Phillippe has been removed to the Bastille, to the lower dungeon.  At midnight tonight I will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes.  That should give you ample time.  Never have I needed more to say:  One for all, and all for one.  D'Artagnan."
D'Artagnan!
This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
Athos, please...!
Where are you going?
If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.
All this time... I was a lost secret.  But you were hiding all your loyalty, all your love.  You were the Man in the Iron Mask.
The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
Your Majesty... This man before you... He is royal blood, the same as you.  To spill it is the one thing even you cannot do.  It is against the laws of God, and of France.
Food, moron.
I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --
Cowards!  Twenty run from four?!
Magnificent valor...
Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.
Sire!  I -- How did you --
Did you know... about Raoul?
It's Marvosa -
Yeah?
Bullshit...
You can cut the shit, asshole--
Did you hit him?
What did the six-toes have to say?
Let's roll -
What's this?
What?
Something wrong with you Marvosa?
Alright, where is she?
Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
Anyhow...	you wake up and she's gone. But--  --this is my favorite part--  she leaves you the keys to a brand new Beemer.
Yeah?
Where up north?
You always carry a gun with you?
What exactly did you see?
No, but I'm listening.
And what did you do?
I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you.
There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
No...I'm in some trouble...
And?...
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
I've got a better idea...
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.
You know this time, there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time.
Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
That was her - the girl... We have to go.
Tubbs, these people mean business.
I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
Ditched you?
What would your - boyfriend - think?
No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
Where am I going?
Long gone, huh?
Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea.
What have we missed?
The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply.
How long do I have?
If there's any doubt, we matched the indents of the bitemark on the note against the Smithsonian teeth. This is your boy...  He folded the bottom part, including what Lecktor tore out. In this enlargement of the back side, oblique light revealed impressions.  We can make out: 'six-six-six'.  I didn't spot it until I had this high-contrast print. I advised Chicago as soon as I saw it.
Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place...
We got an ad order in tonight's "Tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now.
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
Who did he ask for?
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
Tell me now.
Get me a plane!
You got the message Lecktor called...
He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses.  If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him.
He's a very shy boy...
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
Parking permits...
Not yet.
The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code.  It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do?
I'll take you.
The developing room.  I need to... see you.
Who?
Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
Do you imply that I'm a queer?
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecktor is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him?
Linda King's desk.
She doesn't have a Rolodex.
Yeah...
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.
I don't understand.
Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
I don't want to do that,
'Intimate? !"
Molly?
Me, too. And very erotic...
To do what?
Blue is cold.
Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby...
He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.
Can I have one of your cigarettes?
Then why?
Come home with me.
What's the problem, Molly?
Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...
I know... 'Out in the good air...'
Meet point's up ahead!
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
I figured I'd ask you...
She got all right?
Of course, you don't.  I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.
And?
Yes.
Why should I tell you?
Pray tell.
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
May I keep the file?
No.
I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you are, Will.
Why does it feel good?
Glaser Safety Slugs?
Kevlar Second Chance.
Hey, I really enjoyed your set.
Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that.
Sitcom...?
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
Andy!
Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
You signed for five years --  So four years, seven months.
Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!
You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
I can't move my arm.
Really?
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
Maybe I should talk to the natives.  Shoom boom boo ba!  Shoom boom boo ba --
Five.
Cue the commercial!
Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!
Popcorn?
Andy, the theater's that way!
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
I'm not comfortable with the last sketch.  I DON'T do drug humor!
Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
Give me the book.
I, I was asked to do this material - -
Goals are important.
Excuse me, Andy...
So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like playing casinos.  The audiences don't work well for him.
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you.
Sure...
They are dead.  In either case --
He's gonna make it.
Weird.
Hallelujah!  You are my savior, man! My own personal Jesus Christ!
There's something about him, isn't there?
Why you're here?
Thanks... for the drink.
Just get me outta here.
Yes.
All right --
Do you still want to meet?
I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?
Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
We have only bits and pieces of information.  What we know for certain is that, at some point in the early Twenty-first Century, all of mankind was united in celebration.  Through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I.
Do you know why you didn't make it?
Do you understand, Neo?
What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?
Set down in there.
And she knows what?  Everything?
She helped you?
Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
How...?!
I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.
What's funny?
Morpheus believes in you, Neo and no one, not you or even me can convince him otherwise.  He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.
But an Oracle can.
What did you just say?
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
What is it?
That I would have to make a choice...
You can't!
What?
What?
No one has ever done anything like this.
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
Where is it?
What are they doing to him?
Yes.  They're moving him.  I don't know where yet.
Tank, you're hurt.
They've burned through the outer shields.
Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
Yeah.
See what I mean?  A question please...'Is this what you call living?'
And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE...  I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it?
'Art thou the King of the Jews'?
Get out of here before this really goes up.
Nervous?
Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
Listen, try a place with some sun. Swimming pools.  Palm trees.  Girls in little French bathing suits.
Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
Drinks for everybody Tony...
Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
I don't think I should go home looking like this.  You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?
Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.
You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.
Hey...you got nothing here.
Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this...
You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
Don't you move!!!
Hello, Michael.  I've got something for you...not much...but...
I think we should see your uncle.
I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?
Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.
Michael, give us a lift.
Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
What's a'matter?
He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them?  Lock her up?
Wasn't a book...was a short story.
Nothing.
Sure...it's not that...I mean...
Bore.
See that...know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you?
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin.
and a double for you and Charlie here.  And put it on my tab, willya?
Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?
Yeah, it's your father's.
I know what you're going to say but don't say it.  These drinks are all on the tab.  I'm gonna see you this Tuesday payday, I promise.  I give you my word.
Just keep him quiet.
-- But he does seem very nice.
Dinner?  Again?
Just plain 'Joe'?
That was 'Joe'.
Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
I hate parties --
From the Korean War.
You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party.
Honey, please.
Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.
Paillarde of veal.
And that?
What do you do that for?
Yes, sir?
Toast?  No...just the butter.
And what would that be?
I didn't say.
Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?
The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and --
No.
I'm not stepping anywhere --
'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.
I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop --  Instead it was --
Is there any more to it?
Shall we adjourn?
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice.
What are their feelings?
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.
In English, please.
I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed --
You're overthinking it --
Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.
Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got good news.  As I was telling Drew, I've been making a little hay while the Bontecou sun was shining -- two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger.
What have you done?  You've gotten the old man fired!
But I didn't mean to do it!
Not time yet.
Don' be facety, woman.
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?
Jennifer.
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
Confused, huh?  About what?
Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.
What are you doing here?
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
What are your intentions?  To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool.  I don't get it.  You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset.  Who are you anyway?  And what are you eating?
No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
I wanted to apologize, Susan --
I mean I appreciate that.
Where are you going?
Almost.
I'm sorry about --
You're here?
He's taking a nap.
But there's so much to tell you --
Will it?
'Love will find out the way'?
I believe that, don't you?
Susan --
Joe, that's the kitchen.
What a good idea.
Good morning.
Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
Joe --?
I'm not everybody.
What's it like where I'm going?
Yes.
...I'd like to be alone for a while.
Excellent.  What is it?
And more.
I couldn't sleep.
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
You're what?
Which is what?
Those were my words, Bill.
Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.
'Yes' what?
I think you know --
Please.  Talk to me --
This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka --  Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.
Good morning, Dad.
I don't like to interfere.
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
Aw, you're tough.
I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --
You don't know anything about Joe --
But what?
Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.
Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it?
Nothing lasts.
You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --

Well, what then?
Slam it?
Should I wear it?
You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?
My wife.
So you're holding my calls?
Shit. Wrong room.
Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me.
Leonard, it's Burt from the front desk.
I know you said you didn't want any calls...
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
I like your car.
Jimmy?
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
Then you shouldn't have to ask.
Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.
Such as?
Your wife?
His name was Jimmy.
What do the police think?
Kill him.
I did exactly what you told me. I went to		   * Dodd and I said that I didn't have				* Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
Don't talk about my wife.
Yes.
* Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this -			*
Beer, please.
My boyfriend told me about you.
My name's Leonard.							 *
Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking -
I'm not appealing the decision.
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
Shut your mouth!
Did you? I musta forgot. I'm Teddy.			    *
Things change.
It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts.
It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
Who?
Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
You really want to find this guy?
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson.
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
Prove it.
She's gonna use you. To protect herself.
Why?
I didn't sell -
How do you know this?
How do you know him?
You're not coming?
He knew about Sammy. Why would I tell him about Sammy?							  *
She wasn't diabetic. You think I don't			 * know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong		    * with you?							*
Why? You're never going to know.				  *
You probably.							 *
Your name's Teddy.
I should kill you.							 *
Bullshit.							*
We know these people...!
And...?
They'll kill Gina.
He is fine.  And we know the jokes. When it gets vengeful, things get messy.  When they get messy the wrong people die...  Everybody gets it.
Okay.  What'd you spot...?
Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
Sure.
What do you like to drink?
How's he not your husband?
I insist.
You know how improbable this is...?
Would you find me...?
Is this the protective male talk?
If they attack you...
Red light, green light, Jos?
You got something to say, Jos, let's hear it.
How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
Then it don't work.
Anything?
Where we meeting 'em...?
They watching us watching them watching us waiting for them?  Or what?
No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
How much we looking for?
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...
Their loads are poly-drug.  "E" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan "H." Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network.
Hey, fuck him.
There is "undercover."  And there is "Which way is up?"
I am asking.  You to me.
What's your take?
Eleven to seven he blows it.
Go ahead.
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
So what do you want?
From whom...?
Never heard of him.
Control your men.
Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
So?
You mean with the flowers...?
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
And...?
Conveyance?
Importation value?  At twenty-two thousand a ki...
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
You're not looking for the Statue of Liberty at all.
I can tell, can't you?
Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am?
Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?
That's pretty Freudian, Joe.
Shee-it...  Kee-rist, you really know the ropes. Wish to hell I bumped into you before. I'm Joe Buck from Texas and I'm gonna buy you a drink, what do you say to that?
Tomorrow when some piece like that's scratching your back in a Fifth Avenue townhouse, where'll your pal Rizzo be? Nedicks.
Let's see how you look. Fine. You look fine. Now I'm gonna have to have that other ten...
Oh hell, forget it.
Smart thing for me to do is haul ass outta here.
I drug in a cot, if you want to stay.
I want you to stay, okay? I goddam invited you, didn't I?
I'm impressed. You're a killer.
Miami Beach is the only place for a real hustler. Florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world. They lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes.
Hey, you're good! I bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried.
Not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're okay, you're okay.
Well, I made it. This here is Ratso Rizzo and I...
I'm scared.
Well, just exactly what the hell you think you're gonna do? Die on me?
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
A drink? I've got some nice gin. If you'd prefer something else, they'll send it up...
What d'you want?
Listen, I gotta have money.
Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.
I'm lonesome. I'm lonesome so I'm a drunk. I'm lonesome so I'm a dope fiend. I'm lonesome so I'm a thief, a fornicator, a whore-monger. Poop, I say, poop! I've heard it all and I'm sick of it, sick to death.
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
Ready for hard work, son?
Getchmis olsun
Two kilos.
Want me to take over?
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
--the water like "'weeps" through the cement, see. Twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. All we do is use Gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. Pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, It's a two night operation, maybe three.
How far?
Those mountains? are they?
No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.
No, I'm not afraid.
Yes...?
Just what?
...are you with the Consulate?
Just Erich.
What they give you?
I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me.
No... It looks like your going to have a new court.
Get the... midnight... express.
But how would you get into the shaft, Jimmy?
You gotta be fucking crazy!  You got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in Section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs.
You got your stuff?
Okay?
It's already been cut.
...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?  If we knew where he hid it.  Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere.
Why the suit?
Billy, what's the matter?
Know what?
His name?
Hey, you can't...
Jeremy...
You really love flashing that thing, don't you?
There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster...
There's some weird shit here.
There's really people living down here?
Show that to the station manager.  Tell him Leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt he don't have someone down here in ten.
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
A mistake.
The kid...
My God, what the hell are you...?
What are you doing down here?
You better tell me what the hell's going on here!
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.
You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.
Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.
He was just doing his job.
It's me. Can you hear me?
Don't.
It's no use! They know we're in here!
Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes...
Oh, come on, come on!
Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...
Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
I'm not much of a critic.
If you don't mind, perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime.
Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin--  and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer.
You're very kind...
But what?
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.
Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...
I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
I thought it was time you two should meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow, Misery.
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against marriage per se. But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again.
I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens.
You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?
What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?
I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an "n." I told the saleslady "n" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name.
Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?
Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
What about a bee...?
I've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right!
Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter when you finish? I can fill in the "n"s.  Will she be her old self, now that Ian has dug her out, or will she have amnesia...?
Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?
Annie, what is it?
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?
It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
Stop--stop right here.
Could be the weight of the snow.
You really think Sheldon's out there?
"There is a justice higher than that of man. I will be judged by Him."
Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever.  For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.
- pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence..
How grateful?
On what.
Magic...
Sean, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about... Isn't going to be easy for me to say.
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
A change of plans?
If it'll make you feel any better, you're going to take a lot of Aussies with you and make me a lot of money.
Where?
Outrageous.  I won't let you take control of my company.
Fight a bit of a cold..
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
Damn.  Just when it was about to get interesting.
Well do you disagree with that?
Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar. Big bloke, ginger hair. They're into something.
Wrong.  All we've got to worry about is Ambrose.  Nyah will take care of Nyah.
So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.
What can we do' mate?
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Hola..
What's you name?
Awfully short notice..
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
Just like old times?
What did you think you were doing!
No.
No.  Should I?
An idea, yeah.
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
Right now only Ambrose knows that.
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.
She's got no training for this kind of thing.
Yes, I believe that's right.
- good.  Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got -  - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth.
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
..not in time to save him.
..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
Now how to get in there.
Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop.
A visit from an old friend.
You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
You asked for my help.  You <u>asked</u> for <u>my</u> help...come on...
To friends.
Satisfied?
Is he serious?
Did we get it?
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
Ethans right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.
Claire...Hey...
Go ahead.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
Yes.  I see your point.
Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.
It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close.
Here's to  you, Luther.   To being off the disavowed list.
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
Why should I?
What was your deal with Job?
How will you make sure Job will be there?
In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll.
OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors.
Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Im coming to you.
Would you remove your hat please?
I'm willing to take the chance.
Why not?
Sure.  If the main character does.
Abort.  Thats an order.
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
Jim...?
- no.  She cant know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  Theres too much at stake, Ethan.
You got it.
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.
I have no money!
I won't pay for nothing.
Where you been?
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.
Where's Ma?
You're not sleepy?
You look tired.
The guy died.
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
Oh, Cosmo!
You haven't once said you like my dress.
What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.
At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. Things are very bad in my house.
We're supposed to do fifty apples. We only got twelve done.
Why?
You don't have to help me.
When you get engaged?
Why?
I don't know.
No.
How many men since then?
Stupid yourself.
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
Stop it!
I've got you.
Snap out of it!
I'm telling you you can't.
What are you talking about?
You look beautiful. Your hair...
That was just so... awful!
No thanks.
What's the matter?
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
I'm freezing to death.
Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini Clark?
Will you marry me?
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
How near is she to death?
Then let's set the date.
Yeah.
Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother.
I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.
I can't. I need my family around me now.
Will you live here?
Did he tell her?
Hi.
No. But I have a hangover.
What about the moon?
Hi, Loretta.
We just come from the bank.
I know.
He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
Don't make yourself sick.
Talk to him.
Moving in?
I'm sure she did.
When I was twenty-seven years old, in Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips.
Thanks, comrade.
Sorry. That was rude.
Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
It's Cosmo's moon.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
You got me.
What are you talking about, you fool? Her fianc's in Palermo.
Burn her anyway.
There are?  Tell up.  What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?
I see.  Yes, of course.
Halt!  Who goes there?
You're using coconuts!
Am I right?
Where does he live?  Old man ... where does he live ...
Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ...  Oh! how d'you do?
The same!
Knights Who Say "Ni" ... we are but simple travellers.  We seek the Enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who ...
What word?
How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
None shall pass.
A scratch?  Your arm's off.
Stop that.
All right, we'll call it a draw.
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
Well, what are you then?
Ni, ni, ni!
We shall attack at once.
What?
Too late.
Behind the rabbit?
You didn't bother to find out, did you?
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
Good idea, O Lord!
Well?
Exactly.  So... logically ...
Nothing... There's your ninepence.
I feel fine.
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
'Ere.  He says he's not dead.
Why?
Did you kill all those guards?
It's just that when I'm in this genre, I tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...
Father, lad.
Who are you?
You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!
Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
Make sure he doesn't leave.
Camelot ...
We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.
... I Bet you're gay.
No, no, this cannot be.   I am sworn to chastity!
Well ... yes ...
Hurry!
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
Sixty.
She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does.  You want to be careful.
You've got three broken ribs, man!
Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
Mother....
The order of seating at the Upper Servant's table is arranged personally by the Queen herself.
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
That can wait till the weekend.
Don't think I can't persuade her.
What brings you here?
Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God.  You must miss such magnificent views.
Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.
Surely --
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
She'll never understand it.
She'll think I betrayed her.
Mr Brown.
You are well?
They're ready now.
John?
I was told you were in a fight.
I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this.  I leave for Deeside --
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
You should never have gone out in such foul weather.
Then they may read about me.
I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.
I stay here because I am happy.  Is that such a terrible crime?
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was right.  This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk.  Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close.
I see the Prince of Wales is here.
We're going to lose.
A fine choice, sir.
We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
Where did you find it by the way?
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...
Why?
How long has he been this sick?
There is one other matter.
I have a letter, ma'am.
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
What is the matter with him?
Does that thing work?
Could you play ARCADE with that?
We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...
Nick, Alex, how are we today?
I have to talk to you.
Alex, you don't know how long I've waited for this.
No, wait.  Just listen.  I hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name.  As soon as I turned it on, Nick.  It said my name.  How could it know?  And then, I asked it where Greg was, and it said, "In here".
It is.
So how did it know my name, then?
It turned itself back on, Nick.
Then leave her.
SLIP-STREAM.
Jesus Christ!
What are you looking for?
You're not coming, Alex.
You don't get it, do you?
I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
The clock's already ticking.
We can't reach that!
What is it?
Listen to me, Alex.  These counselor's don't know anything.  They're full of shit. If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.
How did you get here?  Did you play the game?!
Then we'll go home?
Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which?  The liar...think!
I'm thinking!
It means she's screwed up.
One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware.
So start at the beginning...
Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
So what's the problem?
We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.
Howdy!
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
What did I say?
So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
How...  how'd they know I was here?
So, what did they say?
I...
Wow!
Your Aunt called me.
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
My name is Rita.
Betty Elms?
Hi.
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
Betty.
I can call them... I can call my dad.
Was anyone hurt?
Number 17.
No...I need to sleep.
I don't know.
Mulholland Drive.
No.... I don't...
Okay.
No. Just the coffee.
What's wrong with that?
"So... surprise"...
"Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... "
"Before I kill you."
Rita... I know what you're doing.
No, we don't.
Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.
Yeah, what for?
You see what I mean...
Hardly.
Not here...no thanks.
No...
Doesn't it bother you to see this kind of brutal death ? I mean , I can understand the old man's infatuation with the stuff, but not you.
Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
So where does this lead ?
So what do we do ?
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
How long till the room fills ?
Do you have something better to talk about ?
Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?
That was eleven years ago.
NO. Don't. You'll get a shock from hell if you touch that seat.
What's next Walt ?
Be very, very quiet...
Issues ??? This guy has the damn subscription to every psychotic issue I've ever heard of.
This probably isn't the bet time, but I really have to pee. Can I pee ?
Don't eat at the console.
It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.
I made my bones on the street, you know. I did Riglioni in his own house. I was made in the Family, okay.
I see here that this guy has made deposits into his own account for the last four months. Each one in the amount of $100,000. He then puts in deposits into his girlfriends account.
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
Any priors ? Any police record ?
Why don't you just stop fucking around and just die !
You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive.
I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.
And how much do we pay you annually ?
Thank you, sir. I was really hoping for shares, or possibly cash... but this, this is really personal.
What about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the "Park" ? Wasn't that a computer glitch ?
I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
Is it as good as I hope it is ?
He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.
So who are these people with the Boss ?
We can't afford too many surprises.
I've got five bucks that says someone dies here and now.
Look ! Look !
Was that the Old Man ?
That is repugnant. You have the habits of a goat.
Thank you very much.
Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !
Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?
What an incredible view !
Are you okay ?
Well, I make good investments, I lead a double life as a secret agent.. I....I ... I have very rich parents. I have always had a lot of money.
I'm talking to you asshole !
I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I'd be glad to see Central Park at night.
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
He was right behind me !
Ow. Son of a .....  Did I ever tell you my theory on Star Wars as Porn ?
Good morning.
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
My mother took this course with you at UCLA...&quot;The Foundations of Poetic Thought&quot;.
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
How did you know my name?
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
Well maybe you should join a hippie commune. But let me tell you something. Sooner or later it's gonna be your turn to take out the garbage.
Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way.
Wow, you walked out with my mother?
I'm not authorized to trace licenses for civilians.
Do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life?
Seriously.
So you're saying...What are you saying??
Hi honey.
Yeah.
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
Reason? What reason?
Thanks.
Umm...can you come in for a minute?
I'm glad you're here.
Do you have any pictures if her?
She's beautiful.
I know that.
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
Hi.
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
There's water in your bathroom.
Don't wake up Vada.
My parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. She's remained a woman of mystery to this day.
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
Get married?
I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.
You ratted on my mother??
Boy, you're really into this.
If he has a heart attack you're carrying the body down yourself.
Boyfriend?
Do you think your friend's up in Heaven now, looking down on you and watching you all the time?
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.
Where are you going???
Never heard of her.
What's he smoking?
Right.
Yeah I guess...sort of.
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
No?
What's that?
Doctor Helburn, what a surprise. In the last couple of days we've changed your oil, realigned your brakes, balanced and rotated your tires, aligned your front end, and flushed out your entire cooling system, I really didn't expect to be seeing you for another three thousand miles.
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
Uhh sweetie, I wou... I wou...I wou...
I should do this myself.
Who knew that when I started working in the finest foreign car shop in LA, I would also find the light of my life.
Then you'll be all set.
No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just needs to have his oil changed.
He was caressing.
Hi!
Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.
We may go out for coffee after the meeting so don't expect us before midnight.
You're Nick's mother?
Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Oh no, I, I...eh...I couldn't.
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.
Do you know him?
No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.
I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.
Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.
Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.
Of what??
Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to join us?
Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?
What am I doing here????? What am I doing here?
I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine.
God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
Ex...ex, ex...
You are perfectly healthy.
It's still available I hope?
I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
Hi.
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu.
I just had a terrible thought Harry.
Home sweet home.
Dance with me?
This is where we are.
Goodnight Shelly.
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
VADA!
Dad?
She likes to play bingo.
HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
Are they ready yet?
Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive.
He's okay isn't he?
I found this.
In the garage.
Hi.
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?
Who's that?
Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
Why?
She's shy.
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
No.
I don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis.
I won, I won!!!
I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place.
At what?
I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
Hey look at this!
Hmmmm, interesting.
You have no personality.
Is that your Dad?
Do you remember her?
Heaven.
Here.
Bed wetter!
Hey Vada, guess what we got?
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!
Jump in the water!!
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.
Get up!?
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
I dunno..
Uh huh.
For what?
Yeah, it's in the contract.
Long trip.  Pretty nice of you to come.
Stay, huh?
You don't miss much.
Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring.
You think...
He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th...
Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it.
You flew all the way h...
What I mean, when I say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. It is vulnerable and endearing. And that is annoying as shit.
This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
I give.
I suppose it's too late to start over.
Needing.
Digger and George are with family in the Hamptons until Monday morning.  Brevity is even more in order than usual.
What else did he tell you...
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.
Don't you have to be somewh...
Well.  You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...
Jesus, we're trapped!
I just think you're wrong, is all.
Your call.  You can live a lie. In a fabulous selection of Red Roof Inns.  Or you can make one desperate stab at hap...
Uh, Kimmy...?
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
Well.  See.  That was a... reflex to see if it would...
I saw the show.
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
They both have some growing up to do.  But they're good people, they're starting with love. They've got time.
I think he's been fired.
And you think he's kept this to himself.
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
Well, you're a little early...
Well, sure.
Every day.  She makes the bed.
Should I whistle down a cab?
Big weddings are so strange.
You miss her, huh?
Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...
And I was thinking this could be our last time.  Alone.  Together. You know?
I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts.
It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s...
I'm up against a deadline.
I asked you...
What's up?
Jules, what's wrong...
Actually.  Lower.  I am the fungus that feeds on pond scum.  Lower. The layer of mucous that cruds up the fung...
Lower.
I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
It's not just a gag, huh?
And to m...
All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life...
What a sweet little picture.  Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!
And yet here you are.  All celibate and reclusive.
You got the money?
Barnett?
Don't worry, I'll take care or it
Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare you.
I said, I've been real tired.
What did you say your name was?
You going today?
I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. I'm John Triplette... a friend of Del Reese... I was at the airport. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm a great fan of hers. If there's anything you need, just give me a call. I'm at the Sheraton South.
You bet.
Well, it's probably because it would help him.
How is she?
Have you talked to Triplette?
He's going to run for president.
Barbara Jean.
Hi. I'm John Triplette.
What's he running for?
Yes, but we're just singing.
Come on. He's a crook.
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
You bet.
You know anything about the stations here?
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
You must really like him.
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
Have you seen a woman about so high?
Hey, there - You seen my Winifred?
You in music?
What kind?
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
Weather's been awful. All those bombs dropping. It changes our weather. Sure not like the good old days.
Listen. Maybe I should go...
Bye.
Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
How long have you been with them?
Hello.
Yes. Who's this?
I'm not sure. Where?
Yes.
Well...How have you been?
Hello.
I don't know who you are.
Hello.
Stay.
When did you think it would happen?
Thirty?
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
What time?
That's for sure. At the airport - that's where it was. At the airport, there in one of those gift shops... Anyway, you better take a break.
Oh, no.
Where's Bill?
Where are you going?
You know Bill is really mad at you.
I mean...
No  Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.
Probably a little too long.
Come on back to bed.
Come on.
I'm Opal.
Oh --
Ah... Peter Finch.
Peter Finch -- he's English.
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
Got me an audition tonight.
You sure do it loud.
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?
Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?
That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?
Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...
By all means, knock yourself out.
Hasn't it?
Divine intervention.
Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum? And who made the decision?
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
Who is we?
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
You've heard of it?
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
How come you never talk?
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
How is it?
Hello Mickey. We've never been introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me. I was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial---
Yes.
Yours.
What I'd like to do---
My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?
Not to anybody. She sings.
That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?
Where's it parked?
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?
...developed between the three of us. We're kindda in this together, don't ya think?
If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---
Yes.
Hypnotizing.
They had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us.
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
Take a wild stab!
Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your book. I'm impressed. Good work on Curtis Fox.
What's the travelling arrangements?
Who?
Are you all set?
Yeah, we met. They're good men.
Jack, could you stay up here for a while?
We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes.
Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'- tastic! I think that interview stuff's too long, we can lose some of that. Keep the girls, keep the long hairs, keep the Hun brothers, keep the black guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest. And cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that. Cut it after I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was a whole new team.' Don't even let him answer. Fuck him. Then cut to me talking about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in Dr. Reinghold laughing.
How's it working, Scotty?
Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
Since he and his wife have been in custody, they've killed---
No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!
You a union man?
What's the matter, boy? Never smile?
She done moved to Detroit.
Yeah. Look, I'll be sendin' you the money from now on.
Oh yeah?
My father's the preacher.
So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
How d'you mean?
Get out of here!
What d'you mean?
At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a long ways from Alabama. Really got under my skin, though. Almost didn't come back.
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
Ain't your fault.
Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'.
Yeah. Well, I do.
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
Hi.
Your boy.
What d'you mean?
What about that girl?
I can see why.
Hey, watch out! Guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too, huh?
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
Don't look so scared.
Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby.
Don't, Duff.
Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's.
About ten dollars.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
No point fixin' it!
Ain't you goin' to say something?
I don't think that'll happen.
What you gettin' all pretty for?
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
They all got families to support.
Wouldn't have known you.
I said, I come to town with a girl.
No.
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
Take it easy, Pop.
Jesus, I told you to watch it!
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
How often does he get like that?
Come on, Pop.
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
Well, what're you going to do?
It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.
Well, it looks like we'll be getting our new school.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
Man, you won't like that back seat.
Well, if it ain't Duff!
Baby - want you to meet Duff.
Come on, Will.
Shut up, Will.
Got a thick feelin' here.
So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target.  You'll get yourself killed.  Just keep talking.
Let me get you another glass of wine.
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
There are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries. They're dissolving, Case... slowly, but they're definitely dissolving. You have just long enough to do the job.
Why'd you do it, Armitage?
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.
That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.
Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.
What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?
Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.
What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
Bright enough to be dangerous.
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
Where the hell have you been?
What are you talkin' about?
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
You haven't got it?
Where did you here that?
I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?
You've been calling her name.
I'm going in.
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
I'll get the car.
Once I kicked, I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. I apprenticed a razor girl in Osaka. Went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. Been taking care of myself just fine ever since.
When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
Peter... What do you think you're doing?
Like what?
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
YOU DID.
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox!  Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal.  Oh look. Class is over already.
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
So, you were a geek. Big deal.
Now this is cute.
Hi!
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
Don't tell me... You're Medieval Barbie.
Well, excuse me for caring about words.
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
It's my dad. He worries.  Hi, Dad. I miss you too.
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go.
Uhh, no.
This is where the stories are. You are going to become friends with these people. You are going to party with them. You are going to hang out with them on weekends. When they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo!
Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.
What if I say no?
That's your story!
Hey there.
You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
It's just for a couple of months.
No, I mean, no big whoop.
Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
Hey, Josie, hold on.  You've been hiding something from me.
Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
Boys.
I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
Our penguin, right?
Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.
We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
Aloha! Welcome!
Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?
Are you having fun?
Wow - I-
By name.
That's not true.  It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just...
But I have to go out. Something's happening out there.
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
<i>                      This is a thing called a present. The whole thing starts with a box...</i>
<i>                                     ... Birds of a feather.</i>
Help me with this thing!
I don't know.  COuldn't get the right price, I suppose.
Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
Come back here!
He needs professional help.  I think we should take him to a psychiatrist.
I love you, Jesse.  Come back to me.
You two got a thing going, or what?
Oh Jesus.  I'm gonna be sick.
Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out of me!
Okay, schmuck.  What do you want me to do?
You okay?
That's when she started talking about Fred Krueger.
No. Never.  You think that's what it is?
You want to talk about it?
You should eat something - you'll feel better.
You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.
I'm afraid to go to sleep, I'm afraid to stay awake - I'm ruining your party. They're gonna put me away for sure.
Hi.
Yor dad picking the music again?
And you don't want to keep him waiting.
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
The city that never sleeps.  So what will you do now?
It was great seeing you again.  I'm glad you dropped by.
I haven't been able to do that since I was a little girl.
That was different.
The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good.  But we need to know where the bones were hidden.
Oh God.
I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.
You're late.
My mother's dead.  Died in her sleep.
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
I can't believe I just did that.
To who?
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
You sound like Peter Pan.
We can try again.
What are we going to do?
Nancy...
Oh Christ.  Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night.  They sedated her.
Who is he?
You do volunteer work at the hospital?
The whole facility was shut down in the Forties, wasn't it?  Some kind of scandal...
If he continues having these outbursts, I'll have to have him isolated permanently.
Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room.
I'm sorry, Neil.  You brought this on yourself.
Lovely to meet you.
That was such a great evening.
We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
No, thanks.  I'll just look around.
That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.  You'd be wasting your money.
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...
Hello.  Hi.  Hi.
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you.
You'll have to prove it.  This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it.  State your claim.
Why is she in a wheelchair?
Busy tomorrow?
I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
Oh please sod off.
Well...
Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
What?
Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you dressed like that?
I don't know what happened.
It's not going very well -- and it's our last day.
You disappeared.
I thought I'd give it to you.
You were saying...
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly what are you doing here with Anna Scott?
Yes.
Yup.
Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
Bella -- this is Anna.
Do you want to stay?
But she said she wanted to go out with you?
That's nice.
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
I was called and I came.  What's up?
Ahm... room service.
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film?
I did.
Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine.
Buggered?
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
No, sir.
Can I help you?
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
There's something wrong with the goggles though...
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
Right.  No one else?
Try 'Flintstone.'
What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan.
Was it you?
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
But you have no proof.
Yes, Mister Harding?
Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
Is there anything else?
Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
On this ward?
I'm not finished yet.
Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?
So do I!
Welcome back.
Good. Why don't you join us?
Yes, Miss Ratched?
Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody.
So long, kid.
I-I-I'm w-w-wet...
H-H-Help!
What is it, kid?
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Sock it to 'em, kid!
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
It's the questions she asks.
Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe anyway?
Neither do I...
Yeah, my feet are cold...
Martini!
Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair.
And how do you propose to accomplish that little feat, my friend?
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!
You can come back later!
Gimme a cigarette!
Hear what?
'Kay, place your bets.
Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?
I saw thum! I saw thum!
I wanna see it...
Man, there sure is an awful lot of poontang around here.
Is that so?
Poker!
Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?
No, this is my first trip, Doc.
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
Yeah, buddy?
You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how!
Bullshit. You ain't got no way out!
Out. It's the way out. So just keep it in your minds if ya ever wanna make use of it.
Somebody's coming!
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
Hallelujah, brother, now get back in bed!
You know, I never got your name.
Yeah...
Hi.
Hit me!
I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.
Yes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my stay here.
Don't know if I can hold it that long, Sam.
Hey, Billy, stop cryin'. You don't have to cry... You ain't got nothin' to be ashamed of. She ain't gonna tell you mother... stop crying...
At this hour?
I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle!
And you haven't heard the last of this!
Is he in an asylum?
Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face.
She was your sister.
Excuse me?
No...  it's just very important that I find him, okay?
He said he thinks a woman he works with knows him.  Her name's Anna. But she won't be in 'til tomorrow.
No, really.  What's she doing?
Were they pen pals?
And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.
A very large pig.
Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.
It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  I knew that was too much.
Smoking or non-smoking?
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
To the foot doctor.
You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?
There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?...  Just tell me what it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
Fine.  Okay.  Forget me.  Leave me out of it.  But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
Uh, I'd rather not say.
He's out by the pool right now.
Hi, Peter.
So.  You found him.
Why are you doing this?
How about music?  You like classical?
I'm sorry.
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
Hi.
There's no such thing.
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
Sure.
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Sure.
Excuse me?
So what do you think?
Faith, this is my mother.
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
But somebody wrote those songs.
No.
No.
What's he do?
I understand, Kate.  What do you think of this garter?
Kate, is something the matter?
Have you seen him with someone?
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
A foreign land full of millions of Italian men...  speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
"Of the Rich and Famous".  Of which we are neither.  Are you out of your mind?  We can't afford this.
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
A Butterfinger wrapper.
We're saved!
I'm hungry.
That was a long time ago.
What did you say to her?
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
I never even got to be single.
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
And then what, Faith?
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
Amazing...
Joan Collins stayed here.
Maybe I can change him.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
Kate is that you?
Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.
What about Larry?
And you are?...
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
I came after the woman I love.
She what?!
And you didn't tell her?
And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth
Well, where are they?
When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
I make it twentysix twenty-three. You're fifty short, Skins.
After what we been hearing about your brother, I thought your throat'd be kind of dry.
This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.
We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against 
What the hell!!!
I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!
Wow... .
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
It was you, Charley... .
Father Barry.
What happened?  What happened?
You know how the Sisters are.
What?
I'd better go in.
What for?
I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.
I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.
Wham... .
Were you really a prize fighter?
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or or human kindness in your whole body.
Why, Terry, who said it was?
His racket?
Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit tryin' to ask things about Joey. It ain't safe for you.
Edie I I never said this to a girl before, I never knew a girl worth trying to say it for, but you you're... .
I had to, Edie. I had to see you.
I don't want to hurt Charley I don't want to hurt you...
That  word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
My hand.
Edie...
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.
Terry, you're bleeding.
Jimmy...
My pigeons... .
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
But you've got to listen to me.
It started as a favor for my brother you know they'd ask me things and it's hard to say no a favor Who am I kiddin'? They call it a favor but it's do it or else. And this time the favor turned out to be helping them knock off Joey. I just thought they'd lean on him a little but Last night with Edie I wanted to tell her only it stuck in my throat. I guess I was scared of drivin' her away and I love her, Father. She's the first thing I ever loved.
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
Give me that gun.
...walk?
You all right, Nolan?
Nice fellows.
Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
I guess it's pretty tough work at that.
Yeah. Johnny Friendly and my brother had other ideas.
What's the matter wit' you, success gone to ya head?
Is Johnny in?
Give me a double.
I know, Johnny, I know... .
I I was just on my way up, Johnny.
Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.
Guts! A crummy pigeon who's looking to get his neck wrung!  You should have  You should have known better than to trust this punched out brother of yours. He was all right hanging around for laughs. But this is business. I don't like goofoffs messing in our business.
Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan...  Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker?
You see, Kayo, the good Lord watches over us after all.
You think one bottle's enough for all them toasts?
You don't think he'd be helpful?
Maybe I will one of these days.
Leave her alone, you fiend!
If I could get my hands on you...
All of my books are based on fact, or legend.  Thats perhaps why they're more interesting and sell in the top spots.
Could it be some kind of college initiation?
Those creatures..!
I am--It's our only chance.
You do?
All right.  Put it on heavy.
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
Well?
The moon is almost gone!
I understand, Master
The moon sinks lower into the hills!  We must hurry to the finish.
You better hope there is.
They are live ones?
Have we in some way made you angry, Master?
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
Ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin!  May it ever be so adventurous!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
No. No! No!
We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky things.
Glenn Michaels.
Yes.
He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?
Jack came out of a bank he just robbed in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start.  Battery was dead.  He looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. Turns out, Buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing.  Buddy says, I'll take the thousand, but we're leaving in my car, not that piece of shit you come in.  They musta robbed fifty banks together.
You're good.
You say you perform in the Miami area?
Wait in the hall!  I have to get dressed!
I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.
You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up?  You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?
I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.
Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.
Jack?
Let's go to Detroit.
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
"Fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying."  Seems this woman's live-in boyfriend, seventy years old, complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve-gauge.  Police found noodles in the woman's hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him.  They'd been together ten years.
I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you?
How long were you with the girl?
I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead.  Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing.  I say let fate decide.
Listen, I gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow.  Why don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen, we'll hook up later?
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
You know they gonna set us up.
I'll make you a deal.  Get out of here. Right now.  I'll do the job with the Snoop, meet you wherever you want and give you half.
Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?
Put it down or I'll shoot.
Who?
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push him off.
The fuck you talking about?
Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it.
So you've done this before, huh?
You know how to use one a these?
Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?
This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
You comfy?
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
Who, Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy. Back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail.  She's a born-again Christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob.
So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
Why, are you famous?
It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
You don't seem all that scared.
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen.
How'd you get this number?
None of your business.
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.
I like your hair.  And that suit.
Not yet.  Don't say anything yet.  Okay?
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
Remember how talkative you were?  In the trunk?  Adele said you do that when you're nervous.
I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.
You coming back?
You're not dumb.
You getting serious on me now?
Oh, hey, Studs?  We thought you were somebody else.
Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
Thanks for your help.
It's a little late for me.
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
Foley?  That you?
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
Good God... they're shooting Midge!
The <u>ninth</u>?
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
And is Foley a part of this?
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
Gee, I wonder why not.
Snoopy.  Glenn Michaels.
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
I wanna talk to you about a job.
It's a guy you know.
You there?
Thing I'm worried about is you.
Right now, son.
How's it going?
You're a fighter?
You're not my type.
What's wrong with you?
That's not Maurice?
Glenn?  No, I don't know any Glenn.
It's beautiful.
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.
He's about to.
Can we change the subject?
No thanks.
What are you thinking about?
Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.
Did you pay the guy the reward?
...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa.  She says he was very gentle.
...the fuck is this...
Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.
You know the football player, Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.
On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?
Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
Yeah.
Rafe's girl, Evelyn?
Good shooting, Danny!
Didn't you say you told her not to come?
We gotta face some facts here.
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
What's there?
This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's World War Two!
Fun today.  Like old times.
Broomsticks instead of tail guns.
Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened.
How's everything?
Sorry.
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
So beautiful!
There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself.
Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't make it, you don't go.
What's your name?
Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.
Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.
I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there, but here.
Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
Rafe --
There've been some complications, Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set.  And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.
I have'na been able ta --
Let's go.
Welcome to the singles scene.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
The only one?
We're going to take you home.
He is kind of cute, isn't he?
Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
Okay. But let's have a girls night soon. Maybe a pajama party.
Welcome to the singles' scene.
But you love me don't you?
You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...
How do you feel?
You drive like a maniac!
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
He's trying.
A lot's happened since last weekend.
Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
Oh, Charlie.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
Hello, Charlie.
Are you for real?
If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.
But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time.
I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little lightheaded.
What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
You're looking pretty chipper this morning.
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
Maddy's party.
No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes JellO.
Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.
I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
What's up?
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
He's not here. We're getting divorced.
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...
Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful?
Like what?
What do you know about hypnosis?
You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three.  We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
Out?
What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?
Hey! How was your first day at school?
What?
Hey! Where're you off to?
Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!
What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
How can he not have a heartbeat?
What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us?
How did it go with your father last night?
Are we interrupting, Andy?
Allright. Calm down.
Why, Beckett?
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
Thanks, you guys.
Aren't you giving an exam?
It could be parasites, an infection...
Why are you getting dressed?
Thanks for leaving school, and coming here, and...  I will be back. An hour, tops.
I'm not going to close the--
I'm not going to die.
Thanks, Charles.
Take it easy, Walter.
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal.
Your Honor, since Rockwell Corp. began construction, the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul-smelling, germ-carrying, pestilent dust. My client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily! Other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage!
Congratulations.
I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.
Find a lawyer?
Get it?
No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick.
A regular all-American guy?
Except... you were gay?
In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?
Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
Can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror?
Excellent work, Joe. I thank you.
What kind of movies do they show there?
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
He was losing weight. He looked kind of tired sometimes. But he was working so hard... Still, I felt something was wrong.  And I can't believe <u>they're</u> saying they didn't notice anything.
Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler?
Were you recently promoted?
And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying? <u>Not</u> about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?
Sometimes it seems like society is <u>run</u> by these kinds of people.
You're the asshole, buddy.
Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... <u>lesbian</u>?
Since when?
Yeah. Do I have a case?
Going on... like...?
Yeah. But we took care of him.
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
That's kind of... extreme, Walt. Andy's private life is none of our business.
I've discovered something interesting, Charles.
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...
Gonna lose everybody out here....
You came for us....
Probably okay to talk to me now.
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually --
But I just wanted to say --
Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
How many you see?
We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.
So where the hell's God now, huh?  I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
Just come with me!
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
...one cutting torch...one handlight here, two more in the cabin...I <u>think</u> two more....
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
No, no, I wanted to get away.
So now you know.
15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.
He can pilot?
Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
How much you weigh, Johns?
How much?
He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?
So you noticed too?
Just shut up, okay?
It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not enough oxygen. Might take a few days to --
Why did I fall on you?
I don't suppose....
Some prophet guy?
I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off.
Oh, no. No, no, no....
Where's Mr. Johns?
Suleiman!
SULEIMAN!
"God is Great," yes?
So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
You'd cut me loose, Boss?
My recommendation: Do me. Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick. Would if I were you.
Such as.
What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
An' this?
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
Seal the cave?
You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
'Then how do you account for me?,
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
Got your sensors?
Geiger counter?
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
No.
State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
Good morning, Dr. Zira.
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
Landon! Send a last signal.
Gone.
Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
Scarecrows?
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
Stop right there.
Of course.
Sure.	In a cage.
What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?
I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?
It's humiliating.
Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
But the proof? The doll?
I SHIT on all o' you.
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.
You're dead, you're fucking dead Elias!
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Come on you can do better than that!
Rhah! What's going on. Rodriguez's hole just got...
Hey Taylor, you okay man?
Dawn! That was it!
How the fuck you get over here man, you look like you educated...
Three years, Jesus, he's crazy as Barnes...
Shit! Morehouse and Sal are short. Fu Sheng's going on R&R, you don't want to send their asses out on an ambush. You got the fresh meat Elias.
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
What are you talking about! 
Merle?
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.
Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either.
And Baaaaaaa! back on you.
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
Or Reno?  They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard.
I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
It might be worth a Martini to you.
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
And do you amuse the guests?
There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.
Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.
He could hardly help suspecting you.
Certainly not to me.
You, too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
Cold?
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?
Cant be too close for me.  Right across the street from it suits me.  Anything else listed?
I hated to go to that place.  I almost went to the police station instead.
They're going to arrest me.
If you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, Betty.  Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?
It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
If you're doing all this just for me.
Funny, I never thought of you that way.  You were so close too.  We were all pretty stupid about you.
Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.
Mitchell was dead enough.
You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
Would I want to?
Me?
What this?
Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
But even if you were in love with me.
Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon.
Private eye?
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
What's this in favor of?
Would it have helped if I'd knocked him down?
Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
Where?
Could be.
It was lying where on the balcony?
How are you two getting along?
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
I have a warrant for her arrest.
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
The only answer I have for you.
Information.
No more for me, thanks.  Remember what I said.  I can't interfere with the law.
You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
Do me a favor, Mitchell. Find yourself a nice secluded park bench.
A little something on account perhaps?
I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell.
What are you doing here?
You nasty, sardonic--
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.
Recently, then.
I needn't keep you any longer, Mr. Clarendon.
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
We've done that.  He's a San Francisco private eye.  Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E.  Had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it.  Goble and Greer is the firm name.
I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out.
Pearl-handled .25 Automatic, uh?  No, it's a Belgian gun... 6.6 mm.
Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.
Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble.  What do I do?  What would you do?
No suicide.
What about me?
You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?
I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
I believe you won decorations during the war.
There are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor.  I'm not one of them.
So-so.
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
I have a rough idea.
I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.
Be nasty.
My first husband worked for the BBC.  I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  I became involved too.  I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it.  By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.
My husband apologises for not joining us.  It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield?
To Ann.
You're kind to be so encouraging.
Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now  the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act.  A small minority thought that England was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it.  The rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking it all.
Give them here.  This tells you how the Women's Peace Camp came to be set up.  All local women at first, then we had support from women and men all over the country.
Terrific.
Charles!  I didn't know you were back.  Have a good holiday?
It's terribly good.
Attributed?
Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.
And you'll join me in a sambucca?
Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages.  Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why.  Your readership will be first and second year American collage students...
I thought it was tremendous.
No, there's a fourth.  Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way.
Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?
I haven't seen much of you.
To the Fleet.
Now, top secret file.
She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot.
Still in love?
Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.
It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.
Thanks.
It goes from Henry VIII.  Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.
Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster.  Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging.  What is it?
I just might give you a ring when we get back to London.  There's one or two things I'd like to... Will you let me have your number before you leave?  Have you ever watched a commercial being made?
It was last year.
Ah, Susy, it...
Thanks for stepping in.
Don't you gamble?
Ever done this before?
Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
You gonna pull?
You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.
We're wasting time.
I'm not armed.
You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?
This is us.  Bank Robbery.  And you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world--
Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.
Yeah.  What's your theory?
Sex wax?  You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?
Johnny, it's the only way.
What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day, right.  He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House...  ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
Time for lunch.
The hell are they?!
Nothing?
I know where they're going.
This gonna take long?
Who's the girl?
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
What's goin' on?
So what'd the other guy look like?
I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.
Billy's on it.  Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.
Mean anything to you?
She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.
We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this.
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
Where the hell is his body?
Georgia.
There's no way you could know that.
It's... it's not like that.
You don't know anything about me.
The real estate possibilities are endless.  Most of the yard we'll just level.  I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said --
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
I... I would take advantage of it.
Quiet.  Would I get the loans?
You looking' for some company?
Mind if I turn on some heat?
What's your name?
Room service.  What do you drink?
Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.
Always.
Uh-huh.
You really are a very beautiful girl.
Where'd you go?
Vivian --
But you want days too.
Three.
This isn't a date.
I think you'll approve.
You liked the guy, though.
Why not?
What about dinner?
You still mad at'm?
You're really pushing it, bringing me here.
Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
Do I look okay?
What's that?
You mean, besides Elvis?  I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy.  He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago.  They stopped at a gas station.  He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other.  Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time.  He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things.  The two of us getting married someday. Having kids.  Stupid stuff.
Right.
I didn't think so.
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.
What's up, where you going?
Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...
I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
What!?
Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.
Fill me in on this.  How'd you and Vivian meet?
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
I don't think there's any sense in --
Edward, we've been together ten years.
'Lo.
Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes.  Now listen, I'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent.  Spend it on drugs and I'll pull your hair out.
Yeah.
I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.
I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
What kind of school?
Want a pair of boots?
You sure you won't come with me?
Couple a hours.
What's your name?
Niece?
In fifteen minutes I can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the Queen.  First, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand.
Either you're European or badly brought up.
Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  All right now, pay attention please.  Salad fork.
They will serve salad.
Miss Vivian --
May I help you?
Are you looking for something in particular?
What is with you?
Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.
The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
You don't believe me?
Every ship but the four you sent.
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
... as ... you ... wish...
Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.
I fear I'll never see you again.
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
We'll never survive.
This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship "Revenge" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts.
Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, "All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." Three years he said that. "Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened.
I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.
Oh, Westley, darling.  Westley, why won't you hold me?
But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
No more rhymes now, I mean it.
Faster!
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
Hello.
You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either.
Has it been fifteen minutes?
Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.
Inigo.
It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
-- wait, just wait --
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  You returned this Westley to his ship?
Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.
No --
-- all that I have and more please --
Thank you for everything.
I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.
We'll wait until you're ready.
Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
You are wonderful!
I admit it -- you are better than I am.
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
Wait a minute.  This is a very big decision.  It might effect the course of my entire life.  I'll have to think about it.  I'll do it.
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
Help!
Yes, what?
What do you mean?
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
You're going to jump on me.
I'm not going to jump on you!
Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
Where would you like to eat?
Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day.  Why waste it indoors.  I've got it!  Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.
What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
You bet your boots, Leo.  It's Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise. Upward and onward.  Say, you'll join me.  Nothing can stop us.
There it is... in red and white! "Springtime For Hitler," signed, sealed and delivered.  What's the matter with you?
How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
What is she gonna do here?
Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending.  I mean these offices and everything.
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
Well, it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?
Max, I...
Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not franks!
Good.  Good.  We go Motel.
Don't forget the checkee.  Can't produce playees without checkees.
Feeling better?
Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.
Smasheroo.  Smasheroo.
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
People can hear you.
Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.
We are falling back on all fronts. Our soldiers are retreating.
We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
Very early. Dawn.
No! Of all...
What do you mean?
Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
Of course not.
Let's all talk about Mary.
You can do anything you've a mind to... and bein' a woman, you will!  That yours?
I think you'd better give it a trial spin. Don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house....
Forty thousand dollars.
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
You should've called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped. You go starting private investigations, using people you don't even know...
Yes?
What's the matter?
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.
It's been three.
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
In a hurry.
Our Deputy sleeps.
You going to wait here for me?
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
We could laze around here a while longer.
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
The only girlish thing you have lost.
For what?
I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions.  Even respectability.
How can you even think a thing like that!
A man should have a hobby.
Only my share.
I'm looking for a private island.
You should... mind it.
That's it. 
In quite a hurry.
Is anything wrong?
Is there?
Norman took a wife?
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
I'll take you to...
I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?
I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.
By gosh, them stiffs are get- tin' heavier and more of 'em every day. They even got the coroner working overtime.
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
Imagine--she was alive. What a horror. Could have been buried alive. She must have run away from the morgue.
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
He's inherited a fortune.
Gosh, you had me fooled.
So--friendly or otherwise--?
What made you steal? Are you hungry?
No, no! I won't sign any pa- pers. You can't make me--
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
I understand from your neighbors that all [them] cats are making noise at night. Dr. Meirschultz has put in a complaint.
Oh, I see. Cats' fur.
But where do the rats come in?
Take me down there.
Dr. Meirschultz, please.
What is it?
The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Lone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
You lie!
I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
But it was really my fault.
Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.
Please, oh, please, I haven't done anything to hurt you.
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Put that stuff back!
I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out!
Well, ain't that a shame. Nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow.
Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
Just this -- I got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line-up, then I'm crazy.
No kiddin'?
You didn't happen to be going to Worth's place, did you?
Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?
Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.
Where'd you get the stag hound?
Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.
He might get some publicity out of it.
Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
That's what I said.
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?
Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box.
It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
How much money have you got?
You are too gracious. These things have some merit, I suspect ... but this--  ... I am convinced, is fine. 
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.
I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!
You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
To lunch.
I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.
She is the soul of that statue.
What are you laughing at?
Yep. Everything settled.
What was her name?
Mia...?
Yes?
I know, Mother.
Rose, who were those scoundrels in Birmingham?
I didn't hear you. I didn't hear that.
All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
Buddy, you're just a child.
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
Here comes Daddy.
You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.
I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?
Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
Son, was Rose in your room last night?
Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
Heh, what a hypocrite.
It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
I think she's gonna kiss him.
I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?
Wow! Brrrother!
He kissed her.
It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
I can use a drink after the plane ride I had.
Are they polar bears, too?
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
Well, you have knocked me for a hell of a loop, old man. A hell of a loop.
Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
Turn up your hearing aid.
Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'.
Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.
Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon.
I am not being brutal to her!
I'm sorry, darlin', I hate it as much as you do.
If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.
She hasn't actually done anything...
Her plan is obvious, plain as day. She's going on a hunger strike. The question is, how do we foil her?
You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do?
I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied?
Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!
Yes, sir.
Rosebaby Blossom, these are the most delicious candied yams I ever ate! Why, they just melt in my mouth. And this fried chicken is fit for a king. How do you do it, Peachbird? What is the secret of your art, Plum Blossom, huh?
All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it.
Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all.
That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.
What have you got in your hair, girl?
Well, Rose, my sleep was a little disturbed last night, and so was Mrs. Hillyer's, and so was the children's. How about you? Was your sleep disturbed, too?
I got an awful bad cold.
I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.
Well, it was a silly question.
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
Your baby?
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
Yes, dear, what is it?
I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you. This operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that I feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl, who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well.
Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
Oh, no, ma'am.
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
No more dentists, no more dentists...
Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.
You think it's that good?
You get nothing and like it.  And if we're not blissfully happy with what you tell us, we arrest you just for the fun of it.
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
It's six o'clock.  Time's runaing out.  Decide.
What do you want?  I'm clean.  I been clean a long time.
Hey now... what the fuck... ?
Know what he's doing, Benny?  He's trying to jog your memory.
Last time Billy-Boy did this, the guy's neck broke...  ... just like that.  Sad in a way. Why is it we don't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
It's bone dry out there.  Everybody's hurting.  The stuff floating around's been cut so many times it's like powdered sugar, but Zimnermann's gonna fix it.
She's right.  If you two are doing the horizontal polka, the last thing you want is a thirty-five pound bundle-of-joy stumbling around, knocking over furniture and calling you "daddy."
Escort everyone's favorite She-Male over here nice and peaceful-like. Let's not have another incident like at the laundromat.  I'll never forget the look on that poor woman's face.
I... I can't find my seatbelt.
Make a hole, Billy-Boy.
This is too fast.  This is <U>way</U> too fast!
We should slow down.
You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.
Who's been giving you history lessons?  Your bartender?
You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics.  The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...
You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?
What about Jack Daniels?  Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.
I'm gonna put a great big, ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face.  How 'bout that?
And, what... what am I forgetting? Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house!
Thanks, but we don't recognize "brunch" as an actual meal.
Your poison's not gonna make it into the veins of any kids this time.
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once.
Alright?
"Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up your mind.
If they crash, maybe he'll run.  You can shoot him in the leg or something.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
I can't believe I'm hearing this,
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
Get his attention.
No more counting the big money for someone else.
This shit was Ming.
Where's your pet gorilla and the female Uncle Tom?
Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
Your eyesight will return in time.
Jabba's palace.
What is thy bidding, my Master?
The same as always.
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
Luke.
Vader's on that ship.
I don't know.  Fly casual.
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.
Hey!
Hey, are you awake?
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
Shall we try and go around?
The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
The code's changed. We need Artoo!
Yes.
Han! Chewie?
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
Good luck.
What are you telling them?
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
All wings report in.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
Tell me.
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
Then you know why I have to face him.
The Emperor has been expecting you.
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
Do you have any tattoos Brad.
Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
Oh....Say something.
Brad, please lets get out of here.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
Well I want to leave.
Maybe we could try it this way.
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
You're OK by me.
You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?
"Sweet Transvestite"
"Transylvania"
Was all I had to say
Want to come again and stay
No no no, no no.
No no no no.
The Master is not yet married.  Nor do I think he ever will be.  We are simply his servants.
...How's the turtle food this week?
I just dislocated my finger.
What's funny?
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
...Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.
Why?
It's okay.
They're all the same.
I always knew you was pretty.
Don't you open them anymore?
Is everything all right?
I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.
Nothin'! I want nothin' from you!!!
You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!
...Paulie. Stop now!
No doctor!
Shape, nothin' -- They're afraid. They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!
I don't like ya face.
Kiss my ass.
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.
We'll kill you, man -- We gotta gun.
This a con?
Nine minutes!
Cost ya a buck.
...How 'bout for the Cokes?
We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels.
Apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations. Balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on Creed's temple -- not much movement from Balboa, duck a left, a right, another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- I mean explodes. The Champ backs off.
How'd you know?
Buddy's in a bad mood -- prostate problems.
Hello, Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles Jergens -- Please, have a seat.
Mr. Balboa --
Excuse me.
Did you hear what I said?
...Screw you.
Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?
Make your teeth yella --
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.
The legs must be goin'.
...Did ya fight last night?
A Rep from Miles Jergens' Promotions was lookin' for ya -- They need sparrin' partners for Creed.
I seen the light. I figure somebody was home.
Fifty years, huh.
Respect, I always dished ya respect.
Whatta you get outta this?
I don't care what they say, you're a winner.
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
...What kinda dog is this again?
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
!! Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?
Ya really like her?
What gaps?
Outta my house I want ya!!
...I can't haul meat no more.
Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.
We can cut that out later. Apollo Creed says he'll let you stay three rounds before he puts you away.
I'll tear his head off.
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
So you decided to help him after all?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
They must've taken it off me.
I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried.
Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
Does it hurt?
Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
Where is he?
What the hell is that?
Here's the problem...  "Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up.
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
You got the will in there, don't ya?
You tricked me, damn you!
Aah!
What the hell are you doin'?
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.
Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
Say, who's this guy laughin'?
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
Keep reading...
If she is well then nothing can be ill. Her body rests in Capel's monument, and her immortal part with the angel's lives. I saw her laid low. Pardon me for bringing these ill news.
Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
Is the day so young?
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
Farewell, my cuz.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
What dares the slave Come hither, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
My poverty, but not my will consents.
Are you at leisure Holy Father, now? Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
It strains me past the compass of my wits.
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
Juliet!
Where is my Lady's lord?
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!
[Within] Juliet!
[Within] Juliet!
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
I have.
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. Nurse, Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
By my count, I was your mother much upon these years, You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
Nurse.
Do you have it?
You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground.
Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.
This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
From Interpol?
Lose them!
About time!
I bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using, it was in his contract.  Cost a nice penny, too, especially that goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive tastes.
Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself.  I can't believe I misjudged you like I did.
Who are you?  IRA?
I'd stake my reputation.
Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?  What's your job?
Alright, Gregor, I'm...
Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the bitch, I don't care.  And yet you don't shoot.  Interesting. Put down your weapon and walk away.
Shut up!
Do you have the material?
He's company.
Where's my information?
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
So, you've got it all figured, do you?
Is it done?
Gregor, is that you?
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
How so?
I would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the American.
Nobody's going to do that!
I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?
Are you sure you won't have a drink?
He sees this differently, as you well know.
You shoot alright.
Yeah, well...  My way works too.
You should watch what you eat.
I ride with fat-boy...
Perhaps the police?
Cigarette?
I didn't know that you spoke French.
That was a nice move you did on our young friend.  Judo?
I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?
What's going on?
We live in a singular world, my friend.
That makes twice now you've saved my life.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
I'm going with you.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
What's this?
How could you have done that?
They don't have the package.
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
In a minute.
I know.
I told you, I quit.
Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.
You slept with her!
My man, how you doing?
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
Do you have the tape?
What the hell happened here?
I should kill you right here! I never thought you'd do this to me but I guess there's a lot I didn't know about you!
Don't spend it all in one place.
Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher.  He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that?  His excuse was the government got it all.
That's right!
I don't know!  Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail.  We can't risk it.
We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
Here it is.
Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...
Oh Jesus...
It's too late...
Just one more.  This one knocks off all the rest.
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80.  You can buy 'em at any store.  There's no way they can pin anything on me.
I'm all ears.
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
I was beginning to think you weren't going to show.  That can't be all of it.
How are ya?
Could it have been in the Mercedes?
OK.
Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?
Be more specific.  A month, a week...
And what's that?
All right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf.
I don't know.
Well we'd like to help you in any way we can.  We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers.
Hello.
Shopping here?
Aw, now thats gonna take time to clear!
It was going to be a surprise!
Suppose I'm not exciting enough for you.
I'll settle for a third of that.
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.
I'm not asking.
Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man.  Just have to...pick a discreet spot.
Did they ever find out who they were?
Are you hungry?
Well what do you know!  An air conditioner.
Don't you want it?
We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.
Is it true, Carter?  Are you in Hong Kong right now?
It's nine-thirty in the morning.
What the hell is that?
Two-hundred thousand!
Invitation, please.
I got my sources.
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
Yeah, that's right.
It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?
I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner.
Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.
Hello.
Carter?
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
You're not very good at this, are you?
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
So are you getting on the plane or not?!
It sounds impossible --
You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.
I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...
Who?
You sound like that all the time.
Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
Get it out of here!
Let me see it again?
Are you okay?
See you in the next world.
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
How was the sex?
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
Let's go.
What is Mac out?
Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it, man.  He's making you do this.
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
All he wanted was some mu-shu.
Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.
Who the hell is that?
Feds asked for me?
Beach Boy.
You have one of these?
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.
What about them?
Shortcut?
You make the plate?
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
You know War?
Excuse me?
No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it.
Oh no, I dropped it.
What a surprise!
Not anymore.
You're killin' me here.
Jesus...what do you want?
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
What?!
You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande...  With two shots of non-fat milk.
You got a boy friend in here yet? Cause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.
Where do we find him?
Yes.
I do.
I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American.
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
What is he up to now?
I'm not running.
Right.
Yes.
See you at the wedding.
What do you expect me to say to this?
Got any last minute advice?
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
God... Of course.  I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm...  Brian -- I've got to go.  The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next.
That's it.  Back to obedience school.
We do it to our dog.
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
Lawyers.  I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is going to be very tough on you.  It's going to be hard to get over.  There will be therapy bills for you.
Is that what I did to you?  Is that what happened?  Did I just not see you?
Look, he's running after her.
Okay, we'll order out.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Same as you said.  What did you call her?  A "man-eater", "a devouring death goddess."
About her upcoming wedding and all.
I think you'd look good in red.
Your two cinnamon rolls.
Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out there.  You don't think they'll call it off...?
Like her mother.
Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday...
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.
Getting nervous?
That's fair.
Everest.  Is that right?
How romantic.
Grandma made me the cutest outfit.  I can't wait to show it to you.
You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.
My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical.
Five hundred.
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?
That was very interesting research George was doing!
That's called changing your mind.
No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
I love you.  I love you.
And the church.
I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?
I'm listening.
I'm going to kill myself.
Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
Lighten up, wahine.
This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
He's going to be the pastor?
I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.
Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene --
And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
They loved you.  I told you they would love you and they did.
We will?  The Symphony?  Okay.  I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.
It's delicious, trust me.
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
I do.
Walter.
Beautiful view, isn't it?
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
I told you.  Nothing --
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
You okay?
Oh!
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
What about the letter?
What are your plans in New York?
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
No, I know that part --
He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
Maybe you should see a shrink.
Go home for the weekend.
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
Are his folks nice?
Magic.  It was magic.
It's you.
Which means --
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
Hello.
What was it that made you know?
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
No.
Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.
Write her.
Do you want a fruit plate?
Dad?  About last night?
Not.
How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
What?!
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
I'm starting to forget her.
Great.
Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. 
Did you call that radio station again?
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.
I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
Fine.  I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
What's wrong with Annie?
Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never did that.  Mom never said shut up to me.  Mom never yelled at me.
Did too.
I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
Do you like baseball?
What about camping?
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done.  Ready to eat.  Do you know how to make juice?
Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone.
God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
Anyway, Victoria's nice.
I thought you were never going to call me.
He's ten.
I read an article about this ...
It takes time --
Want to go up to your office, Mr. Alexander?
You're welcome to one.
How goes it?
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
Who? A scab?
Are you sick, Mama?
Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
A fighter, huh?
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
Let them take it!
I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
That's all right -- it's no secret. My name's Hartwell. I'm from the company's Eastern office.
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.
What is it?
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
I can't.
I can't leave.
Oh. Hi.
Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
I'm kind of busy.
He knows where I work.
Who is it?
Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
What time is it?
You remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hook-up?
A quarter?  Danny that ain't even worth ...
I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if I can get the right price.
Jimmy, where do you find these people?
What does J.F.K. stand for?
Jimmy, look, there's something I have to tell you.
But... why? Why would you pretend?
Can we talk price?
You want to do this some other time?
Come on, guys ...
Don't address me.  I didn't make the accusation.
What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
What the hell is this?
Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?
What?
Danny, I'm touched.
You don't find that repugnant?
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
That's because he doesn't have one.
Whatever you say, man.  Look ... can we talk about this?
That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though.
Turns out he's connected.
The Mexicali Boys
He knows somebody ratted him.
Tom, let's spend the night here.
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.
Golly, I hadn't thought of that.
Where's Bubba?
Yes, sir.
I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.
You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
So, that's Ryan.
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue.
Watching.
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.
Glad of it.
Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I...
Over three-hundred.
No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
That only leaves three.
I wonder where they're going.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
Caen?
You?  Leading a squad?
Beasley's dead.
Uh, Captain...
I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
What are we going to do?
There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen.
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain.
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!
Maybe Caen.
Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.
Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.
Goddamn it!
I'd like to go, sir.
Wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, I can't explain it, but I've seen it.
I usually like surprises.
Speak with my lawyer.
No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
I'll take the whole set.
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.
Keep it.
Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.
No, no, don't go in there.
That's not even a scam.
C'mon, just do it.
I wouldn't get my hopes up Lloyd.
Wait a minute.
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd."  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
Why?
God, I'll have to go on a plane.
Morning.
Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.
Sweetheart, no.  Don't be ridiculous.
Honey!
You think you know what this money is?
I made their lives better.
Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
You will?
No noise, no sound, no movement, nothing!  Hello, Diane?
Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.
Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; "Glad I finally met you", "You always seemed nice", "Wish I could have known you more"...
Nobody knew me before tonight.
Thanks.  But either way it still feels...
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
Nice one.
I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old.  Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.
Stop by later.
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
Okay, this is important...
Little more gas.  Ease it up.  Hold on- minor setback.  Now you feel confident, right?
Let's get outta here.  You want to?
Are you comfortable?
No.
I don't think I am.
It did?
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
I think that we should spend some time apart.
Yeah.
Okay, what did we just decide?
Yeah you do.
She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.
You told your dad?
What?
Okay.
YEAH!
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
Jim Court?
The truck?
Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.
Okay, I'll give here the message.
Hello.  Heard about that graduation present.  Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back.  I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink.  Kickboxing.  You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  I can see by your face, no.  My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
Thanks Lloyd.
Yeah Lloyd.  What are your plans for the future?
She wouldn't get out of the car.  I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car.  But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's gonna, um...
Am I going?  Am I going to England?  I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right?  What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy?  There's no way.
I know.
Just her name.
My car.
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
Oh, I was just going to...
I was gonna...
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
Later for you, Luke.
It's not a charade, all this?
We started without you.
I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -
Where are the guards?
God bless you, sir.
How you feeling, all right?
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
It kind of looks that way.
I'd never ask you for money, you know that. I don't even like talking about it - money, favors - I find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -
Get the contracts and I'm sure you'll do very well.  In fact the worse things get the better you'll do.  It was a "pleasure."
I don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.
What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?
You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door;  I've never understood that.  What's next?
You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time?  I know.
Eight hundred, give or take.
We need to talk.
There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines.  I don't think that's a good idea.
How's the name search going?
Can't we hold him?
We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.
He's broken his pattern.
Shit.
I did that.
Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?
No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
Jesus, youre just as whacked as your son.
What are you going to do?
But youll never get away with it.
I think he's doing Dolly.
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
About what?
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
Two.
Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
Of course not. Who wants to? Whats the point if we dont get caught? Wheres the glamour in that?
And now, drum roll please...
Oh yeah.  We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. Its been an ongoing discussion.  Heads or tails?
We had to have financing.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
Not good. How you doin?
Ssshh! What was that?
The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe.
You're getting obvious.
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
I dont know.
"If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way...
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running...
Randy Meeks.  He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio and we can grab a bite.
Sid, I'll seeya tonight.
It's all about sisterhood. Everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but...
I hate scary movies.
Take it off.
You ass.
What are you talking about?
What do you want?
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.
I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
Asshole, Can't talk.
You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben Damon.
What kind of a game?
What?!
Yeah.
I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
Nope.
Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
Alright Kincaid, no where to?
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
Four? There are five.
Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's Events?
Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.
Detective Kincaid?
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.
What are you doing here? I told you to stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.
I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.
Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.
Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
Off the record.
Gale, your engine's still running.
Sidney, what happened?
Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap?
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
Geez.
Possibly.
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
Nobody said she was an actor.
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!
Oh shit.  Hello? Director's office.
Page 22, Candy's big moment.
Who's this?
But you know my favorite name?
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.
Alright, I'm here. Now what?
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
Nope.
She can't get both of us.
I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
What are you doing here?
And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
Oh Billy... Please... God...
Jesus, SHIT!
No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
I'm so sorry... please understand.
You know that's not true.
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
Sshh... it's okay.
Uh-huh.
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
Hello?
You're forgiven. Bye now.
I don't think so.
I don't know.
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
Why? You wanna ask me out?
I have to go now.
Gotta go.
What do you want?
Is this some kind of a joke?
What do you want?
I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.
I wanna play a game.
I don't know...
Afraid not.
Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.
Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
What are you doing here?
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
You girls ready.
Have they found my father?
We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.
She's tough.
She staying with you?
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit.
Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
You owe my mother.
I have no idea.
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
Are you alone in the house?
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
Can you see me right now?
No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
That was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.
And are the police aware you dated the victim?
What's Leatherface doing here?
You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
You're crazy -- both of you.
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
Do you really think Billy did it?
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there.
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
Who?
How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.
You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school.
With that set of lungs -- she should be.
I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that.  And nobody's going to swap with you.
What do you think?
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!
You didn't know.
We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny?  That wouldn't be... shocking enough.  Wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.
You can't see the whole... the whole complete act yet.  Not yet.  But, when this is done, it's going to be... so... so...
I... I doubt I enjoyed it any more than... Detective Mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows.  Isn't that true?  How happy would it make you to hurt me, with impunity?
You should be thanking me.
And, I remember breaking your nose.  You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
Here he comes.
It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.
There's a bucket here.
It's a bucket of vomit.
Is that clear?
Same color and texture.
It's a package deal.  You get the phone with the office.
How's that?
Nothing.
There must be something.
You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould, didn't you?  About catching this guy.  You really want to believe that, don't you?
I wish I still thought like you.
I'm, sorry, but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues. I've seen so many corpses rolled away... unrevenged.
Never in my twenty-four years, knock on wood.  I've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it.  Never fired it though.  Not once.  You?
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
Sorry about that... I just...
There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow.  I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
By telling you this, I'm trusting you more than I trust most people.
For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.
Yeah.  Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.
Think about it...
By the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead.
What are you talking about?
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?
As soon as this is over, I'm gone.
Because he is John Doe, by choice.
Tell me it's not true.
Put your gun down!!
You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting.  I'm sorry.  It's really none of my business.  It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  That's how he is.
I don't know, with this case.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
Why always like this?  Only after the fact... this sudden realization, that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in them, that person will cease to exist.
But Mose Harper said...
It's all right, ma...I been watchin'... Only I wish...
You all right, sergeant?
Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word...
They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.
I didn't give any order to fire!
But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches.
I've come now...
Well, the reward still stands...
Come f'r my rockin' chai'...ole Mose.
Talk!
Keep talking.
Nothing for you to see.
What you goin' to do?
Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
<U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!
Think she means for us to follow?
Well, you're a widower now...
No...She's not...
'I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound mind and without any blood kin, do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to Martin Pauley...'  I don't want your property.... 'Sides, what do you mean no 'blood kin?' Debbie's your blood kin...
Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.
Was your niece about their age?
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
'Dear Miss Laury'...He spells it with a Y instead of an I...E...Wouldn't you think he'd know...
Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!
It wasn't much of a letter...
Martie...don't go! Not this time.
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
Where?
Stop that!
I mean the armchair!
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
I'll do it myself.
Hey, flower child, the sixties are over.  And this stuff is hazardous to your health.
What are you doing?
Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?
Who was that?
Martin, it's not funny!
Now, what did I do to deserve this?
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
Where have you been?
What?
Let me guess:  Another short circuit?
Will you finally cut it out?  Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here.  And maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone?
Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.
What?
How did you get me out of there?
I really hate to bother him, but...
No, I've never seen him before.
It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...
I think it's starting again. You know... there was something peculiar.  If only I knew...
Hammer?
Well, look here!
Look at this.  The lock is totally demolished.
You did not like the speech?
You are a gentleman.
You have the last act?
Wait!  Will you desist!
I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo!
Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.
We will all be put in the clink.
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
A woman of property?
I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.
Where is the play?
Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
Where are you going?
My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?
We are lost.
How will it?
I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.
Ethel.
But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?
Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
He looks well enough for a mountebank.
I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond.
Your Majesty!
When will you write me a sonnet, Will?
Will!
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.
As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.
I have, Master Shakespeare.
Who are you, master?
Oh but why "alas?"
Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.
Then I will go with you.
Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations.
An excellent beginning  Let him bea duke. And your heroine?
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the dukeOrsino.
Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.
How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
Your aunt?
Like a sickness and its cure together.
Oh!--it's--it's--oh, it's a house of ill- repute!
Here we come at last, my lord!
In the same fashion as chess.
About this guy, this Hugo person.
No, she's not in. Without waiting for any more, he replaces the reciever and walks to the door, where he picks up the mail. On his way back from the door, David emerges, ready to go to work.
When are you going to let the police know?
I can't do it.
Family? Family? Friends? Drugged-up wandering suicidal search of the self fuck-ups don't have families, David.
What's the problem?
How much did you pay?
How much did you pay?
What is this?
Doesn't it worry you?
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
You looking for me?
But they know.
They know.
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.
What?
No. Why should it?
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
Aroused and inflamed.
-- instead of what he is --
I wonder how he did it?
No.
Be careful.
Sshh.
David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.
Well, you certainly had a good look around.
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
No.
You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it. That's my advice.
Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
I don't see the point in that.
Leave him alone.
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
Boy, am I glad to see you.
Now you thought of that, not me.
Expecting anyone?
Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --
Interesting.
What?
It's OK. There's no problem.
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.
Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.
No, I've never seen them.
Yes.
Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not.
Would you like to talk about it?
Two hundred.
Two hundred pounds.
That's what it cost, David.
I thought you'd gone to work.
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
But they sneer, don't they?
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
You get the job done.
Hello.
I see.
Writing seems easy.
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
Working nights?
Yes.
Both, sir.
Offering it for debate.
Your watch.
You're in a good mood today, George.
Chicken salad.
Anyway, you remember Harold?
Don't you think there's too much gold?
I don't know, I think...
What?
-- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear --
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
We cannot go into this later.
Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?
You're late, George.
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
-- Anyway.
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
No, I know.
I know.
Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.
You know what I'm talking about.
Like what?
How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
How is she?
I went to school with her husband.
You do it.
How long you had this?
-- Well no. It never came up.
Okay... but I want you to know one thing.  I've got to look great tonight, I mean I have to look great, okay?
... I don't get it done often.
What's wrong?
No.
And?
George...
Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?
Baby...
George...
We're upstairs, George. Now come on. Behave yourself, and for Christ's sake, do me a favor. Don't let me drink too much.
Don't do it.
He just completely ignores me. He could have at least said something, introduced me or something.
-- don't you want to --
You don't think so? I do.
That sounds like me.
-- sure.
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
-- Jesus --
-- It's Malone's.
What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
I don't know... Jackie?
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.
Hey, what's happening?  Mary! Telephone.  What's the matter?
Yeah?...
What with?
-- yes, George.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.
I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
Maybe you don't even like children.
George.
When is that, George?
What?
I know, honey.
Television or movies?
Now, Jackie --
You did fuck him, didn't you?
Didn't you, baby?
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
Yes.
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
What difference does it make?
Baby, please don't... I love you.
... well I'm glad you told me.
Yes, yes, I did.
No.
Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.
But what?
Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves.
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
-- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here.
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
What do they look like?...
Godammit, George...
I wanna hear about it.
I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!
That's got nothing to do with it... You're so beyond my comprehension I can't even discuss it with you.
Want a drink?
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap.
Awww --

You're home.
Sid.
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
Of course not.
You and your touchy investors.
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
Does she know about us?
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
I'm not. Maybe I am.
Well, he is.
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
You're really a love -- you sure?
I thought you said things were great with George.
We don't think marriage is important.
How much?
But why Egypt?
Why don't you ask for another one?
Well he's not exactly a friend.
Sort of.
I'm hungry.
How's it going, Doc?
It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.
Yes.
Maybe he showed me something.
Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
Mommy...
Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?
Please...
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about.  I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny.
Oh I wouldn't think of it.
Delbert Grady.
Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.
No.
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
It's good to see you.
Hi, babe.
What do you want me to do about it?
I...
Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!
Stay away from me!
Stay... stay away!
Jack, stay away from me!
I'm Jack Torrance.
Have any trouble finding us?
I'd better collect my family first.
This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.
Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter.  I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.
You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
Huh?
Your mom's not around, is she?
You got a pilot's license, Marty?
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller.
No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!
How come?  Sister?
Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.
She's afraid.  Come on, tell the boys you're afraid.
Right here.  Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this.
Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.
Hold on.
You see?  We've got the voices.  They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me.  We just need charts -- harmony -- chops.
Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
All right, I am, I know it!  All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic.  Perky.  I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, "That child is pure sunshine.  She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess."
BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
What?
Shirelles.
Of course.  I'm a nun.  Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.
I don't know.  Mary Lazarus, what do you think?  They're pretty raw.
Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting.  Make it look easy.  Again!
Babies
A cigarette?
Thanks.  So which one are you? Sister Bruce?  Sister Doug?
Bobs
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences.  I've learned so much.
Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free  We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house.
It's contraband.  Don't ask.  But I wanted to give you a treat.  A sort of... thank-you gift.
Are you leaving us?
Run!  Take off!
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
You were unhappy?
I see.
Sit down.
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.
Is this all the food I get?
What's wrong with my life?
Sometimes it's not enough!
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
Please let me try.  I'm begging you.
And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
You sent for me?
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
What are you doing here?
You saved my life.
When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant?  What do you want -- cheap thrills?
I don't know anything about bodies!  I mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let me sing.
And if I don't?
Ten flights?
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
What'd she say?
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
I really can't talk about it now.  The place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show to do.
Well..  thanks.  I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes.  I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here.  I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.
I can't go with you.
Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a wonderful world.  Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  Dead or alive.
Where's who?
We're looking for Mike.
But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?
Get her!
There she is!
Joey?
She's gettin' away!
You didn't shoot!
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
We've got to save her!
Peace on Earth.
Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.
We did it!  We actually sang a chord!
I'd rather sing than do anything!
Ice cream!
An... entertainer?
I don't understand.  Where is she?
But she's been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.
But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
Where?
If we could speak alone.
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
Who took the meat?
Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.
What the hell are you doing?
Why did you move the body, Doctor?
No bleeding.
Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm?  How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?
It is sacrilege!
For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
Do you have these persons' wills?
Damn... damn... damn...
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected.  We sent for the militia.
I manage fine alone.
Where are we going?
What is it?
No, I couldn't...
What now?  Where is she?
Why... why are you like this?
Forgive me, I didn't know.
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
Other people?
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
These scars.  How did you get them?
What are you on about?
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
Blood.
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
Returning to the Western Woods?
You cannot kill what is already dead.
Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
Go home.
She has confessed.
All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow.
Thank ye.
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.
All right then.
Thank ye.
That old man of his still livin' over there on Clark Street I believe.
Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too.
Yeah.
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.
Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.
Leave.
What in the goddamn hell are you doin'? It's the middle of the night.
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I?  Was I?
Last time you got mad and run Morris and them off and said to stay away from here.
Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
You got that shit right.
I don't really understand the meaning of the words.
I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life.
What's all them books?
Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.
What's you last name?
What are all them books?
How come you're carryin' them around with you.
Do you like to play football?
Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?
Wait a minute. You want to go with me? You can meet my mama.
They still around, your folks?
How did your mama die?
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
Who did you kill?
Will you stay here with us for a long time?
Where'd you get them flowers?
I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a while.
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.
What do you mean?
I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it?
'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?
It was still alive when you buried it?
That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.
She said she'd see me later. That's kinda good, right?
Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for a Mister Turner tomorrow and a closin' up shop early.
It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you?
Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.
You walk fast, don't you?
I ain't got nothing but them books.
Karl, what in the world are you doing here?
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
You scared me.
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
Yes sir.
I was thinkin' I could use me another helpin' of these potaters.
Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.
Listen everybody, I know this may sound corny, I've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but I'm going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table.
I don't know why you're so weirded out, this is not San Quentin, it's just a nuthouse. Most of these people don't even know where they are, they're not gonna hurt you.
Let's just go, Marsha.
You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?
I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book -- a notebook. On every page it says "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1." He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin.
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
Yes.
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
Like me, too.
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
And your father? Is he from New York?
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
Do me a favor, will you?
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
Hey, Auggie. How's it going?
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
Seven eighty-five out of twenty.  Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Looks like someone forgot a camera.
It's yours?
They're all the same.
I've never seen anything like it.
Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work.
Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?
No, he's not. You are.
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
So what did he say when he called?
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
Every word.
Like what?
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.
That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.
Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up.
Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
Seventeen.
I'll be back in about an hour. Watch the register while I'm gone, okay?
So I can get my job back.
Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.
Sure, Auggie, I got it.  The store's closed.  And when do I tell them it's open?
Does it hurt?
Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.
A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.
I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
Son-of-a-bitch. You're some piece of work, aren't you?
I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
Hi there, little brother.
You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late.
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
Well, if you put it that way...
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
East Seventy-fourth Street.
Of course. Where else?
Here and there. Around.
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
Twelve, thirteen years ago.  Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry... I was trying to reach for one of the books up there ...  And then, I don't know, the sky fell on top of me.
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
Celebrate? What for?
It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes.
I don't know.
You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you?  So how much does it come to?
Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.
Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.
I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right?
Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...
With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first.
What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
Boat has two batteries.  Lose one you run off the other til morning. Carl musta lost both, so Miyamoto there gave him one a his.
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him?
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
They're not his neighbor, like you are.  He is a husband, a father, he risked his <u>life</u> for <u>their</u> country. The same as you.
And your evaluation of the defendant?  Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?
Did you say more?
Well, the freighter.  The twine. The blood.  The knife.  The cup. The watch.  The second battery. The phantom lantern.  The fishing gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's <u>eleven</u> things...
Your line of work.  You must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth.
Robbed.  He was angry.
But Carl was a fisherman.  And successful at it.
I should have told everything right away.  I know that now, and I regret it.
My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth?
I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.
And you keep the records, or contribute to 'em.
Here now, what are you fixin' to do?
It's the way it happened, I know it is.
He's looking down.  And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday.  He's proud of the man you are tonight.  That's what counts.
Well, why does it?
Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.  Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing.  But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
Cigarette?
You gaff with the <u>hook</u> end. Blood's on the butt.  Where your hand goes.
So every time you think about showing that jury strength.  Or honor or composure.  Or dignity.
And what's that?
I think you testified <u>all</u> the lights were on.  Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?
I believe so.
So this...foam you found in the lungs.  How does it get there?
Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around?  Or would both look the same.
Is it possible?
Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
Are these your bags?
Yes, Sue?  What is it?
I beg your pardon.
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.
You're welcome.
Okay. 
He even got Charlie's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated.
Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.
It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
But suppose he loses?
Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks?
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
Well, that solves one problem.  We don't have to worry about who to pay first.
Greased Lightning!  Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined!
You mean it's a girls' band?
We could've had three weeks in Florida - all expenses paid.  Lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish...
We didn't see anything -  - did we?
I think they got me.
You don't see any blood?
Where are we running, Joe?
DAPHNE?
Hello, everybody.  I'm the bass fiddle. Just call me Daphne.
Not there - that's the emergency brake.
Done what?
You'd better go fix it.
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
Men?
Steady, boy.  Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
What's going on here?  Daphne - Daphne -
Male and female - the moth and the flame - I ought to slug you!
Wise guy, huh?  Trying to louse me up -
I'm a push-over for whom?  What is it? Who's on the phone?
You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this?
That's some nerve!
What are you giving me with the omelette?
I tell you, Joe, they're on to us.  They're going to line us up against the wall and -  Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh - and then the police are going to find two dead dames, and they're going to take us to the ladies' morgue, and when they undress us - I tell you, Joe, I'm just going to die of shame.
Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive, you know what we're going to do? We're going to sell the bracelet, and grab a boat to South America and hide out in one of those banana republics -  The way I figure is, if we eat nothing but bananas, we can live there for fifty years - maybe a hundred years - that is, if we get out of the hotel alive.  Did we forget anything?
You crazy or something?  The place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you're making like Diamond Jim Brady!  How are we going to get out of here?  How are we going to eat?
All right - so what do we do now?
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
Anything wrong?
Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
See?  She doesn't have one either -  You don't?
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
Yeah - Josephine.
Brand new.
It's about the Florida job.
If there is one thing I admire, it's a girl with a shapely ankle.
It certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here.
Yes, indeed.  It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
No - it's showgirls.  I've been married seven or eight times.
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
This is where I get off.
Well, I'll be - !  He does have a bicycle.
I forgive you.
The New Caledonia.  That's the name of it.  The Old Caledonia went down during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.  But tell her not to worry - this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack - just the two of us.
Don't I know you two from somewhere?
Because I got some plans -
And you'll be in all evening?
The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
Then why did you take this job?
Afford it?
Rough?
Men!
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
Why not?
Thanks, honey.
What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.
Wait a minute, Daphne.  You haven't got a bathing suit.
Are you staying at the hotel?
Which one is yours - the big one?
I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
How's the stock market?
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
- and always the same Four Hundred.
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
Well, I guess I'd better go -
Guess!
A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
Look at all that silverware.
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
Have you tried?
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
Is that anything?
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
Oh, no.  I'm off that stuff - for good.
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
I only wish there were something I could do for you.
Yes, they're here.  Oh - white orchids.  Would you believe it - I haven't had white orchids since I was a debutante.  What's this?
What's the matter, Sugar?
Daphne -
Good evening, sir.
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
Okay, Spats - the services are over. Lets go.
Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint.  Mozarella is just fronting for you.
We got different information.
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
Look, Chief - I better blow now, because if Spats Colombo sees me, it's Goodbye Charlie.
Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
Why dont you get my half sister her seventh hole?
Hey.
Fred Astaire and whats her face!
Id be happy to. Youre welcome.
I blame Tony Pee-Pants!
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldnt split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasnt just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
Whats his problem?
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
And Kat was fully clothed.
I didnt deserve her back then.
Nothing.
Hey.
Hey, you!
Its called character. God, youre predictable.
That was a long time ago.
So, whats your point?
Bollocks, Im sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult.
Im sorry?
Dont patronize me. Theyve clearly been at this a while.
What does your gut say?
Six thousand, right?
Not you. Youre not disgusting. Youre lovely. Just the idea that theyd bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didnt...who never.... I mean, someones dead.
Sorry. Im a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.
Would you grab my shampoo?
The real story is that my mother was a hippie. And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath.
And you thought Id respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
Yes.
Theres a guy on 81st and Madison. You get your results in 24 hours.  Do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them?
Subtle?
Dont they have a limit at those machines?
And what if I didnt want you to...to do that to me?
What?
But nothing did.
What would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think?
And thats when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You havent visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
Like fifteen.
You want I nut him in the boat?
Shes drunk. -er than me. But I didnt really dump you, did I?
What do you say to that?
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
Did your mother know you were going to see your father?
That does it...
You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson!
You're a friendly lady, Miss Johnson.
Well, how did you like the class, David?
I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me...  You wanna hear another story?!
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
Clarence, would you tell us a story that was not true, after telling us it was?
:--THE STRANGE ENDINGS OF NATURE THEY HAVE SEEN, MAY GIVE THE WORLD NEW POINTS OF VIEW AND MAKE THEIR LOVING, LIVING, AND DOING PRECIOUS TO ALL HUMAN...
David Lee...
Readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
Goodnight, Daddy...
Daddy, you home now... that's all I want -- I don't want nothin' else...
Daddy, when is we goin' huntin'?
Wheeew! This is some hard work, but it beats goin' to jail.
From Miss Johnson --
Mister, can you visit anybody here?
What's in there, David!?
Mama, there's hot meat on the stove!
'Bye, Mama...
Can I go when the holiday comes?
Any sign of Sounder?
Poor creature...
Can't sleep?
But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
But, Miss Boatwright, you--
Come, I'll take you home.
Whatcha got there?
Well, let me have it.
Don't take all day at that table, David Lee.
Is he gon' be gone long?
Rebecca, you jest the one I wanta see.
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
I bet you could use a hot cup of coffee, Nathan Lee.
The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
If there ever was a devil in this county, Ike, you is it!
But, Nathan--
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
Oh but OF COURSE children are going to see it!!
Well, anyway... Today children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about the environment.
Why the fuck not?
Dude!
What is this?
<b>And my mom has become so bu-sy that she's raising heck and ignoring me I agree that there is now a battle to be won! Something must be done!</b>
Oh, son of a bitch!  AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!
Cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. You must sneak over zere and shut it off before I return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and I will be shot full of holes. Got it?
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-
Ze alarms! Zey went off!
Who the hell made up that law?!
This is all cause of your mom, Kyle. She's such a bitch-  AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie.
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
I know Cartman, I know.  I see Kenny every day.
Mph rmpmh rm.
Goodnight, honey.
Mom...
You've got a stupid accent too.
Mkay.
So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think?
Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you!
What was that word, young man!?
Viva la Resistance.
WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!
Donkey raping shit eater.
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
Very well, then. I will put an end to the war as your wish and make everything as it was before the war started. But you Kenny, must remain dead.
What's that?
Who is it?
What's the password?
Oh my God...
What's a butfor?
This is terrible! This can't be happening!!
Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
This is sweet!!
Does it say what the clitoris is?
It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too!
"Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris"!
Dude, do you know what you're doing?
I thought you had something planned.
Oh, brother.
Stan!
WHAT?
Thank you, Kenny.
You're all part of Satan's army now!
SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
The F word?!
Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!
Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!
Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
AGH!
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
What did you do today Satan?
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
Yeah!
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?
Check.
I think we're moving.
Evening.
Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
So, are you on for the next one?
The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there?
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!
Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco.  Please proceed.
That was a joke Taylor, lighten up!  Why don't you just hold them up to the lens.  I'll write them down, and once I'm through verifying them, I'll get back to you.
Barnes?
Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
Well that's your call.  Doesn't make a damn bit of difference to me.  Just as long as I get my cut.
What's the use...we're gonna die...
We're going to die.
Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.
I'm sure you'll be all right.
We don't.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?
Yeah.  We did it.
You're ready for the real thing?
And what are you going to do?!
Dawn.  Come in.
So what's going to happen to you?
Sooner than later.
In that case, I accept.
I'm fine.
Where's Taylor?
Oh no...I think there's carrots in here...
I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?
Ok Mac...  I'll talk to you on this. I want to find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back.
Yeah, basement bingo.
Hey, you still here?
Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no 
Who gave it to you?
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
Theo.
No...
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me.  Just make sure nobody's following you. Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze.
Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin!
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
I don't like to talk about it.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for you, son. The beam of light catches Junior's face. He is crouched inside the machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy.
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
Where's Junior?
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.
I just hold it loosely with both hands?
Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!
Get that outta your mouth!
Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.
What's your specialty?
Can I ask you something personal?
So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
Do I want you?
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
You don't get two chances with Junior.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
Sez you!
Lips still for sale?
Lane's closed big fellah, league night.
Some unfinished business.
There's heat coming the door.
Wait a minute --
Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take ... yeasts.
Nice work, Captain sir.
Fifty yards and closing.
Thirty yards.
Norman, please!  Don't!
Anything else?
Good.  Security's been our biggest worry.  Now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight.
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.
Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.
We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
What is it, Norman?
Maybe we shouldn't.
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
Don't get hysterical, Norman.
Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.
He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."
You think he killed Edmunds?
It's not sucking, sir.
Any sign of Harry?
Norman, get out of there now! Norman?
How much damage?
I did.
Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman.
What?
Did you hear me, sir, because --
They switched us over.
Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?
Do yourself a favor, Norman.  Are you listening?  Don't tell anyone what you just told me.
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
Where'd this come from?
Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
I can't feel her bones.  She's like a sponge.
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
"Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft.  Signed, Barnes, USN."
Don't tell me to calm down!
Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.
Forget the sub.
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry.
Diphenyl parlene.
It's for motion sickness.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
It's like a sleeping pill?
"20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... "
It's getting cold.
Do you fear them?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?
I never went in that sphere.
Where is it coming from, Beth?
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
You hear that?
Get away from me!
How's that?
He doesn't wait for an answer.
Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.
You sound defensive.
Nice work, Norman.
Our answer.
This answers one of our questions.
No.  I didn't say that.
These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.
She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
Wisconsin's your answer.
What is it?
It's the squid!  Stop it!
Fine.
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
You know how to work this thing?
Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.
An American spacecraft?  Half a mile long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah, good theory, Harry.
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Good idea, Ted.
How are the others?
You mean they haven't told you yet?
I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors.
Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
Try this one.
What kind of a crash was it?
There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
No, not anymore.
Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.
Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal.
Who are you anyway?
I don't see why.  I don't believe we've ever met.
You saw through me?
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.
What about the princess?
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on.
Blue Five, does that glare bother you?
Blue Five, break off your cover attack.  It's too late.  Make your own run on the exhaust port.  Do you copy, Luke?
No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.
We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.
I found it... It's just not there.
You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...
It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.
No need, everything's under control.
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
Enough!  I already know about the data you've intercepted, but its' too late.  Whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... You will come to know such suffering as only the Master of the Bogan Force can provide...
What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?
I am Luke Starkiller at your service.
First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
No, this hurts.
No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive material.
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
Yeah, but I want Carmen.
Don't think about it... go on instinct.
You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
You can't walk me home.
I thought you were going to help Carl.
Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
None at all... We won.
Do you mean it ?
What happened to your hair ?
It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.
What's wrong with you ?
...I'm sorry.
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
Take care, wilya Johnny ?
Which way ?
Alright, take her out, Ibanez.
This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!
Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.
You still gonna play for Brazil ?
It stinks, you goin.
Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
...CUT OFF !
Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ?
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !
Is that your signature, Rico ?
Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
How bad are you, pal ?
Alright, we're gonna carry you...
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
You. Tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?
Mister Rasczak ?
Sergeant, secure the boat !
Who is...'V'ger'...?
<U>Why</U>?!
They have repressed the Creator.
The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?
What does that mean?
A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?
To join, and become One with the Creator?
'To learn all that is learnable.'
Departure angle on viewer.
That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.
That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.
We could have cut it off at the main computer...
Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
Forward motion, Captain...!
That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator. 
Was he difficult?
Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.
Hold station.
Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.
Reporting as ordered, Captain.
Let it drop, Bones.  You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on.
No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
It would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information. A remarkably efficient system.
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...
These read as identical composition...  ... however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!
Not for us?
Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
Captain, we need further Warp simulation on the flow sensors...
He have any special dietary requirements...?
Well, it had sentimental value.
Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.
You haven't heard of it.
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
Why?
You get what you pay for.
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...
The, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...
Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...
But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill," when I don't have an old mill?
What I need to <u>say</u>...
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
...lost the screw...
You like kids?
I'm gonna be your typist for this evening.
It's for your finger.
Thank you.
What've you got?
...yes.
Hi.
Where you going?
Would you like to <u>see</u> it?  I've got the key back at my store...
Good morning.
Yeah, you?
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
...and we could get up every morning...
What am I gonna do?
I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I <u>tell</u> them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...
But it'll stop the movie.
S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?
Well, I for one, am glad of a little diversion and I'm glad they're here...
We on for tomorrow night?
"The mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed.  <u>Although</u> it is altered..."
Hi!
We did...?
I've been thinking.
It's all over between us.  I've found someone else.
What courthouse?
<u>Wonderful</u> scr...
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
I will.
It's Marty on the Coast -
Okay, look, you, what is she, 19, twenty...oh Christ...
Whyn't you learn your lines?
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
That makes a <u>lot</u> of sense, Claire, that makes a lot of...list...listen, cause the audience isn't <u>coming</u> to see your breasts.  They are coming to see you <u>act</u>. What are you doing this evening...?
What do you drink?
How old are you?
Nice town that you've got here.
Are you all right...?
I mean, okay, fine, but it's a motion <u>Picture</u>.
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
Are you Okay?
Is Mr. Barrenger there...?
I'm very sorry to...
Izzat so?
And I have Mr. Barrenger's Tuna B...
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
I want to tell you something, Wally, he's a pussycat.  <u>My</u> thing is to see everybody does what they said they would and I have to do that.  Now:  what is this you want <u>Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars</u> to do what you're being paid to, you already <u>signed</u> you'd do...?  What is that?
You can't treat me like this.  I'm not a child!
Matzoh!  Are you Jewish?
Look.
That's my...
Hi.  I hope I'm not disturbing...
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
<u>Forget</u> the contract.  Claire.  What is it?
Fuck flowers, we aren't talking about flowers, we're talking about a human being.
What?
Not now, I'm talking to the press. Claire!
...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  When...?
You show Claire these sketches?
-- she's got 'religion.'
Kiss my ass.
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
Doug, the traffic light...
...he's the producer of the movie.
Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?
I...
What's in the case?
And what was it you wanted to say?
My wife's going to have a baby.
Mmmm.  You have children?
I had a witness I would.
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
That, that's <u>your</u> life's blood on the st...
I...
...the finest people you could ever hope to work with...  You have the new Old Mill pages?
Not now.
I'm trying, honey...I'm...look, is your Ma, when is your <u>Mom</u> coming?  Oh.  What did the <u>midwife</u>...?
Does it have to be an Old Mill?  Where have you been?
We're out of money.
Halo?  <u>Marty</u>?  What would they have used instead of an old mill?  We need it tonight.  Marty?  Yeah you were saying...?
Grace, get on the other phone, call that girl: well, call her, and have whatsername send up some <u>nosh</u>...what do you like to drink...?
Why?
I've got a date.
Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.
And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
You cool the broad out?
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...
How was your flight?
What's in all the bags?
Eight hundred grand to show her tits...
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
Where the hell have you been...?  It's...
Don't you <u>touch</u> that...I want them gone.
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
<u>Whatever</u> you need.  The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
You hear that?
Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
He's going to <u>get</u> that calf.
She coulda done better than him.
Where are we?
So what's up?  Who's marrying who <u>this</u> time?
I didn't say that.  Why would I say that?
Mass hysteria.
Daddy was washing Rachel.  In the shower.  What did you think that was about?
Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
Look she's upset --
And what do you do wh...
This'll work, huh?
Annabelle...wake up honey...
Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.
You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.
Hold lunch!
She still packing for her trip?
Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???
Annabelle pick up the phone.
And Mom says anger never, never <u>solves</u> anything.  It makes every- thing <u>worse</u>.
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
I hate her.  I really hate her.
...your hating me.
Are you <u>real</u> mad?
...for Christmas, okay?  Every magician needs a white dove, a <u>real</u> one, they <u>do</u>!
IS THAT YOU?
Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?
Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?
Rachel's job is she works.
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
I've got it.  It's in the can, Cooper can wrap th...
You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!
Rachel's not half my age.
Thank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?  This has been very valuable for us.  And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight.
You ask me that counselor's making a mountain out of a molehill...
Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.
It's a huge moment in their life --
She's a charmer, you'll see.  In fifty years, the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you.
Yet another spaghetti night.
How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
We don't have any coffee.
What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out.
Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother.
So why did y...
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
I'm sorry, I just...
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
I don't know wh...
You WHAT?
Did I hear the word...
Then let him talks to me.  We don't need you to solve our prob...
Moi?
So.  Hopeful.
You try to center on the big issues, y'know.  What it's all about.  What this whole trip has meant.  But then, the <u>really</u> big issues keep swamping y...
The primo stuff is great for pain.
Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle there?
Yah?  Well, even the best mom in the world, the smartest, the wisest, whatever.  Needs to know when to find a Plan B.  Cos Plan A <u>is</u> not and <u>will</u> n...
Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna.  I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...
It's the same choice you made.
My advice to you?  Don't die.
You taught my child that I am some limp dick <u>loser</u>.  Who didn't <u>care</u> about her pain.
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
Ben never mentioned it.
The way you cook.  If you could make love, I'd marry you.
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
Look.  I know they hate me.
It's just an assignment.
They're my kids.
She's not gonna die.
Why in the world would she t...
Can we go sit somewhere?
Don't ever say that.
There's something I need to talk about with you.
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions?
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Really? How many?
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
Must've been hard being poor.
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
Consuelo. Are you crying?
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
Maybe it's for the bestI mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrongPeople who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
So whaddya think?
Twinkeys!
Sure!...
Hi, Scooby! How was school today?
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
What do you want?
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
Fuck!
So? How was school today?
Dad?Do you think that Brady will ever get better?
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?
Hey, Mikey!
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.
You're not.
Ni...
...gger.
Nigger, fuck me hard!
OK.
I dunno...
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
Hello?
Who is this?
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.
I believe it.
That's too bad.
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
Yeah...So you're um...you're married?
How'd you get it?
Is it loaded?
Doubt it.
So like, yeahI caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviewsY'know, I figure I can always drop out.
Henry, what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding?
What now?
--be prepared.
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
What about rule one:  never let the person you are protecting out of your sight!
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
How well do you know this place?
Go fuck yourself...
I hope you don't mind all this--it's just that the networks will eat it up, you know...
I know you're not too happy at this point.  It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances...
You see, it paid off--you broke away from the old guard, congresswoman.  It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore--
Why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!
This was taken when Richter was arrested in Washington state, 1985. He was charged with interstate arms trafficking, skipped bail, and has since been a fugitive.
And what exactly do they intend to do?
Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device, the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years.
Yes?
This dreadful accident could never have happened if your government hadn't cynically and hypocritic- ally blocked every proposal we made for disarmament or arms control!!
Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they?
My seven body orifices????
Major?...Major?  I'm Colonel "Bat" Guano, 701 Battalion.
I did that for your own good, fella.  Now I'm not going to pull rank on you.  When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing.  Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President.
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
What about the President?
Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
Yes!
You aren't sure!
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
Why do you think I ask?
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
You're a good officer, Major Mandrake.  You have a right to know.  It looks like we're in a shooting war!
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command.
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
You're a good officer, Major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention.
That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
I suppose we might catch them off their guard.
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
Go on, Major.
Major, you're talking like one of them!
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
How soon until the enemy finds out what's going on?
Then there's no chance for recall?
General Jack D. Ripper, sir.
I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.
How long will it take to receive them all?
How do you know they were shot down, Buck?
General, stick to the point, please.
Roger, maintain.
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
All right...we're still flying.  I'm taking her down to the deck.
Then this is it.
Between Mach 3 and 4.
Twenty!  Twelve o' clock.
Roger.
If they come down low enough to make a firing pass, they'll never be able to pull up in time.
Well, listen, King.  Could you take her up to about eight hundred?  That'll help you come in at a nice down-angle, and it'll give us a chance for our chutes to open.
No, this looks like the real thing.
Okay.  Check these points.  Complete radio silence.  To ensure that the enemy can't plant false transmissions and fake orders, the CRM-114 is to be switched into all receiver circuits.  The three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the CRM-114, which will in turn block any transmissions other than those preceded by the code letters. You got it?
I thought I should check out the damage first. My gear is busted up pretty bad.
No kidding.
Gee, we hate to leave you like this, Major Kong.  But there isn't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around.
Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---
In about twenty minutes we start losing height to keep under coastal radar.  Cross in over the coast low-level, continue low- level on zig-zag legs to primary, and climb for bomb run.  Any questions?
What's your point, Lothar?
You sure have to hand it to those guys.
What do you mean?
Lieutenant Zogg, what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission?
I'm okay.  What's up?
Are you sure?
I asked you a question, Lothar!
Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
Sure, King.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.
That was really great.
Uh-huh.
Responsibility, progress.
It's really not about anything.
Your a nurse?
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
Stuck with what guy?
You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
Jesus Christ.
A long, long, long, long, while.
A long, long, long...
Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...
Hey, man.
What she doin' in the van, man?
Hey, I'm Sooze.
What do you mean? His girlfriend?
Hey! Hey.
You better! Yes!
It's safe, come on.
Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just joking around.
In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.
You're a drunk and an idiot.
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
No, no, no, no, no, it's new.
Whoa!
Thanks. See man?
Yeah!
You okay, man? You okay?
Will you stand up for me?
Come on. Inside.
So you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? Well, here we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of like one of those documentaries on educational TV?
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
Yeah. So, what about you?
I'd like to.
Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
Erica.
It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.
Hi.
Nice to meet you Sooze.  Hi, I'm Erica.
Um, mother-daughter.
Can you tell me what happened?
Wow, you're cute when you're angry.
No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a limousine to know who I am, alright?
See ya later.
What? What'd you do?
No? Well, I disagree. I think they did. I think they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? Makes me sick.
Well, what am I supposed to sleep off? My life? You know, I'm supposed to go home and go to sleep and when I wake up, what'll I be, Jeff? A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. Right? I don't think so, man.
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
Jeff! Come up here!
No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What is your name?
Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
Your sure as hell right about that.
About things that are important to me.
Oh, yeah?
Okay, what would you have done.
Jeff. Jeff.
What feelings?
Come with me.
So what do you wanna do?
Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
What?
Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out.
I've run out of words.
You're unbelievable.
Go.
Hey, Pony.
Good, man.
No, it's not...
Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?
Yeah, I crash there.
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
Sorry.
Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
Great.
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
Get off my roof!
I hope you're happy!
Hey, Pony, this is my friend Bee-Bee.
Yeah?
You're not serious.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?
Fucking drunk, huh?
Leave him alone, Tim.
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.
And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu.
Ahh!  Baby's got two heads!!!
Is Jack upset that he can't be here?
Hello?
... I don't know.  Probably not.
-- We practice!  Sorry, Cleo.
Oh, thank G-d!  I'm not just super fat!
Hey.  Eyes on your own belly!
Oh no...
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
Yeah?
Hello?
Yeah?
Hannah, we've...
Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate.  Where's my smokes?
She did, did she?  How is the old girl?
Hannah, in order to get real answers from the netherworld, you've gotta have a Christian virgin run the board.  Your kind is pure of heart - the devil won't dick with you.
You sure you wanna go there?
All of you!
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
My best friend got pregnant.
Diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas.
Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.
Roll 'em.
You're going to stay, aren't you?
Good party.
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
I didn't.
Is there someplace we can talk?
I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?
Well....
Hello, Artie.  Good evening, Miss Schaefer.
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
You sure have.
What about all those ideas you had?
I'm all tied up.  I can't.
You're on your own.  Stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
What happened?
You bet.
Hers.
All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?
Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
I wouldn't know.
How much will it be?  I warn you - don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.
Are you or aren't you?
The wind gets in that blasted pipe organ.  I ought to have it taken out.
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
I will not have it butchered.
You know, I'm pretty expensive. I get five hundred a week.
There sure is.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
Joe,  you look absolutely divine.  Turn around!
Don't bend back like that.
The other guests?
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
Keep it.
When did he say it, Norma?
No you didn't.  You took the car.
You heard him.  I'm a star!
I'm the greatest star of them all.
This room has not been used for a long time.
There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.
I'm talking to you.  My clothes and things are up in the room.
Is that so!
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
How is she?
Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
How's that about your being my friend?
This guy -- where did you meet him for the first time?  Where did he come from? Who is he?
Did the deceased ever threaten you? Were you in fear of bodily injury?
Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?
Home?
I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.
Don't leave me.
You're alive! She didn't kill you!
This is my favourite place in the city.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
We're from different worlds.
Let me kiss you.
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
That makes it worse.
You think so?
But what if---it wasn't real?
Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think?
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!
Oh no, not you again.
Why should I believe you?
Nurse! Nurse!
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
What about my proposal?
Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?
Yes.
I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.
I am almost an adult. This is what I want.
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
I can do that.
She did that deliberately.
Your hair looks the same.
Don't you believe in knocking?
Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.
Balefire on you, Selena!
You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.
Who are you ?
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.
Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
It's lovely. . .
You look at them? How?
Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.
Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
What?
Mr. Roebush?
Not enough vodka in it.
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
Brad?
You know what's the problem?
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
I can never get a way from it.
That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?
No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.
Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
Well...  Not quite like this.
Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?
But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?
Sonofagun! Look at this here!
Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
You've been a naughty boy haven't you?  C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
How do you do that?
Hey, boss.
Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!
Yeah? How's it look?
Can you do that?
How you doing down there?
No, we're just going down.
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
Who is she?
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.
Well, don't let me keep you from anything.
Lots of things...
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
I don't know you, lady.
"At a special session of the General Assembly, 178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining." ROSS That fella's becoming a public menace.
Okay? Goodbye.
It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art.  People, I am in love with this machine.  Go ahead, Mr. White.
Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
I don't kiss.
It could make weather!
Computers talk to other computers, right?
She's not his mama either.
Someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us.
You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.
So?
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
Come on, let's give it a dry run.
He's the only one who can operate this --
Hostages?
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  Sleeping arrangements.
You don't have anything to be sorry 	about.  How could I . . .
Let's go to my place.
I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .
Hi.
Sleep well?
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
Lois, someday --
Does Lois know about this yet?
What??
Mush!  Mush!
Artemis? Do you read me?
You have been given a higher form of happiness. The happiness you feel by serving others, by inspiring them to --
Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
Why?
Shhhhhhh!
Wait, wait, wait just a moment. Wait till you've got to know better will you please.  Wait, -- look, I can give you anything you want. I can give you the brass ring, the - er -- unlimited freedom to maim, cure, destroy, chew - plus Lex Luthor's savvy. Lex Luthor's career guidance... Lex Luthor's School of...
He flies as well, then . . .
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
You said it. Three-to-one should get you 								both ears and the tail.
Put down Lex Luthor !
Hey, let's be fair. Actually, there've been two or three times --
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
Free!
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..
Then we must go there too.  To rule. Finally - to rule!  And then you shall have what you want.
He's captured Non!
My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
He's a jerk. I never noticed it before. Seems like a lot of people I know are jerks . . .  . . . Maybe you think the same thing about me. That's why you keep avoiding me.
Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.
But Superman isn't an average man.
Boys, old Lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew. You help me place it on one of your missiles and I promise you . . . if Superman throws it into the sun, he'll get the biggest surprise of his life. I'll be able to introduce Superman to his first nightmare . . . a Nuclear Man!
Lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.
Impossible? Why?
Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . .
But he's never there.
Whoa. . .
What was that about?
We'll all fry.
Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband.
What I need this for?
I hadn't counted on this but . . .  . . . of course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat. I am a ...
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
Ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. Who else could have thought of this aquarium?
Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but  --  --  but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit!  So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101  -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah!  We kept many things underground.
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?
Not...gray.
Hey!
Stop him, Clark!
It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.
Big night coming up?
There weren't any wires. I looked.
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
You're just jealous.
Super...man. Hmmm...
Oh.
What can I tell you? He's my leader.
You and your real estate.
So I've noticed.
I needed this, Y'know? I really needed this. just when I'm nearing the fruition of my project, Big Bird flies into town.  Go ahead! Kill me by inches! Put me on the agony rack!
What's the temperature now?
See?
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
Breathe that air, Miss Teschmacher.
What do you suggest, my dear?
About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?
You're not going to hit me?
I don't understand.
Nothing, nothing. I just want to invite him to tea.
Danger??  Somebody??? Lex  -- where are you going?
I mean the other one!
But you can't ignore these facts!  It's suicide!  Worse than that, it's genocide.
What're you writing, Lois?
How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
Lara, please...
Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.
Who...who...
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
Oh, I've got to get some matches.  My cigarette.
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
How old are you?
And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again.  Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?
Is that real enough for you?
Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.
They're killing me by inches!  Go ahead! Make me suffer! Milk me dry.
Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
I still don't get it.
Sort of.
What is this??!
Well  --  you've got me! What can I say?
This is California. The richest, most populous state in America. And growing like a sonofagun.
Still, foolishly, perhaps, I had a theory that eliminates the Presidential push-button.  I was doing my homework...
Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.
Yes.
Yes...fine.
Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.
Then...when did she get better?
But you said...
Are you sure?
No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.
I've tried to stay out of it.  But it turns out that's not so easy, Sam.  You've gone and got yourself this lawyer.  Mitchell Stephens. You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos.
She said she's got to be home by nine.
They can look forward to that.
Because I have to.
Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses?  That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?
Dolores.  No one calls me 'Mrs. Driscoll'.
I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing...
Those are all from the fair last year.  Abbott and me were judges at the pet show.
That's the way I thought of them sometimes.
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
What do you mean?
I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened.  That's how I remembered it.  But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty.  Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?
He knows that?  Billy?
Anything you didn't understand?
What do you think?
You hate it.
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
We've only got honey.
He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I feel like his monster.
No.
Hey, Billy!  What brings you out on a night like this?  C'mon in.  Take a load off.
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
Nicole?
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
What about Doreen?
Need a hand?
Here we go.
I'm in a car wash.
Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?
What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want.
It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief.
Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?
You are?
I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time?
Why were you scared?
Mrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
Why not?
What's that?
How do you like it, Nicole?
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.
What are you up to, Nicole?
What do you mean?
He couldn't look at me.  But I looked at him.  Right at him.  His secret was mine now.  We used to share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I owned it completely.
Well, there's the Hamiltons.  Joe and Shelly Hamilton.
Hello, Sidney.  Wanna table?
Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -
When do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road?
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
Friends call me Otis - sometimes Tricky Otis.
Take it easy, Susie.  He wouldn't be much of a man if he didn't understand my concern.  Would you, son?
Is it news to you?
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
Why are you trembling, dear...?
It's just as if I've seen a ghost today...
Then whose fault was it, J.J.?  It was someone's fault, wasn't it?
You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that.
Susie likes to keep her girlish secrets.  But in her heart of hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. Now, what about YOU, son?  Not just tom-catting around...I hope?
Susie, I'm sorry if---
You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks?
Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black.
And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too.  You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington.
Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.
I know Manny Davis.
You told me you'd break up that romance - when?
Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!
Are you listening?
Sidney, I told you -
I thought he would.
Could this be that boy?
What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...?  Where's my other shoe?
But...
Who else phoned?
Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.
Go home, Sally.  It's late...
I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie...
Frank, you don't listen!  J.J. just told you to shut your mouth!
Did you now?  On which bounce?
No, I don't mind.  I'm busy too.
If there's a funnier man in the world than Herbie Temple at the Palace...uh...pardon us for not catching the name, we were too busy laughing.  No, make that 'screaming'.  It's sweet of you, J.J., thanks. Probably see you at Twenty One tonight.  No, for supper, late. Right. 'Bye...
And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?
You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so touchy...
Listen, get a good night's sleep - tomorrow's another day.  Feeling sorry for yourself won't help.
I didn't do anything!
Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you...  Will you forgive me?  Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...?
No!  I'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother!
Please... let... the kids... go...
They told us not to ask where they got it.  I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know.  I didn't want to know.
We should abort.
Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
So this other guy?  He's a terminator too, right, like you?
Where we going?
Can I stop by my house?
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
And that's another thing.  You could lighten up a bit, yourself.  This severe routine is getting old.  Smile once in a while.
Not even of dying?
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
Alriight!!  My man!
"No fate."  No fate but what we make.  My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- Never mind.  Okay, the whole thing goes "The future is not set.  There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."
Drive for a minute.
No!
Out of the way, John!
It, John.  Not him.  It.
It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
You broke my arm!
This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
The CPU from the first terminator.
... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow I can still see.  Look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do I have to --
It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!!
On Furtwngler.
What does he mean, too correct?
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwngler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
I guess so, sir.
So what is it?
Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwngler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
What?
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwngler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.
Let Furtwngler go. Please.
Mine's the Eleventh.
What's in those files?
Bruckner's Seventh, Major.
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
Sure.
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
When I last saw you, I was unprepared. I did not know what to expect. In these past weeks, I have been thinking more carefully and making some notes.  You have to understand who I am and what I am. I am a musician and I believe in music. I am an artist and I believe in art. Art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. I must confess, however, to being extremely naive.  I insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics. My entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because I thought that I could, through music, do something practical.
I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.
What telegram?
I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.
Von der Null?
Yes, I know who he is.
I'm sorry.
I have illegitimate children.
Stop this, please, stop this now!
How can I know such a thing?
Is it true you're going to interview Dr. Furtwngler today?
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
Show me.
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwngler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
And ask him about his private life.
Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. Furtwngler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. Furtwngler.
You were in insurance before the war.
Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section since 1936. What instrument did you play?
Aren't I worth waiting for?
Can you handle it?
Anything else?
Great.
Not lately.  Did you check messages?
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
Do you understand?
So, it's from the future, is that right?
Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's.
I caught one, back there.
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
Good field-dressing.
Look.  I found it.  Isn't that it?  Cyber Dynamics Corporation?
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.
Let's go.  Time to move out.
Is this enough?
What are you doing?
So.  You're a soldier. Fighting for whom?
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
Surrounded by living tissue.
You've heard enough.  Decide. Are you going to release me?
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.
That stuff's two hours cold.
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us.  How do I look?
You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts.
I'm so sorry.
I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...
Oh, God... !
This is nuts.
Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...
See you around.
Please...
There's a ladder here.
There goes a thousand dollars.
Never did catch your name.
That's classic.
Where are we going?
The maitre d' called you Christine.
Want anything to drink?
Take the picture out.
No!  I'm sick of this...
It wasn't his fault.  He thought it was his only way back.  They fleeced him real good.
They did the same to him as they did to you.
Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.
Get us out of here...
They won't...
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
Think about it!  They followed you every step of the way.  There was always a safety net.  The taxi, there was a diver.  At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...
It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
Don't move, you bitch... !
I have to get to the airport...
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.
One brother, one sister.
Julliard, yeah.
Never better.
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
You need anything?
Call that number.
Trust me.  Call that number.
I thought you'd like this.  Best thing I ever did.  If you don't want to do it, DON'T...
It doesn't matter...
Do it for YOU.
What's this all about, Connie?
What have they been doing to you?
How do you know?
The phone's dead.
Do you know how to change a tire?
What?
Really?
Split it?
Yes.
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
Your brother was a client with our London branch.  We do a sort of informal scoring.  His numbers were outstanding.  Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...
I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
It's different every time.
Get rid of them.
Drive in.
Dinner's in the oven.
Mr. Van Orton... ?
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Not much, I think.
What's the trouble?
What's this about?
There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room.  We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.
What?
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
What's happened...
Someone's playing hardball.  It's complicated.  Can I ask a favor?
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
Hi.  I'm Todd Aubochon.
And what kind of sleeper?
The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had.
That could have been worse.
Luke, can I talk to you?
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
I didn't do it.
So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?
That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
Yeah.
Nell!
It's still an electric shock!
Why are you working with her? Mary Lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a Ph.D. in psychic studies.
Eleanor, how was the drive?
All the carvings.
And then what happened?
Someone is playing with you.
Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...
I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance.  Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell.  A communal story.  Someone starts it.  Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it.  This story shapes what we see and hear.  We interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it.  That's what this experiment has all been about.  That's what it was about, the experiment's over.  I'm pulling the plug.  This is my fault.
Why would we want to do that, Nell?
The children want me.  They're calling me.  They need me.
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
What's this?  What's this... this picture?
Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
Why?
No one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.
Jeez.
Good night, Theo.
You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?
I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep.  And then I'm going to get some brandy.
Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment.
Not for you, clearly.
Am I a thing?
I'm not.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
It's not a compliment.
As soon as you get dressed.
Anything but Japanese.
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
No.
How'd you like to kill someone for me?
When you find the guy, you'll know.
I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
You think I'm staying?
What more is there.
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
You're kiddin' me, right?
Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man?  Do the background check?  Go through a three-day waiting period?
Who'd you butcher at the house?
Huh?
What's so fucking funny?
Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
Bring the motor around.  Bang out in front, right?
What was that, then?
... No, I went in for more improving pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.
Said it went on for donkey's years.
Ashamed.
Disappointed.
Modelling.
Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
What line is he in.
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night.  She called me, asked if she could come over.  She and Terry had been -- having some trouble.  Lately.  I don't know about what.  On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.
You don't seem bothered.
You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?
Won't he be looking for you about now?
Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up --  in increments.
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
It was you.  Downtown.
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
Don't you work with Ian?
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
Yeah, that's right.
I would have preferred staying home, me.
You'll be looking forward to getting back, then.
Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
Hey.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
There is?
Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.
I don't get it.
How we gonna get that lucky?
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
Tell you ...
She could've had the deal!  I would've handed it to her if she wanted.  I would have given her everything.
He was deaf when he wrote this.
Hi, Mr Crane.
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
...or maybe I just haven't played 'em right, I don't know. But you're--
I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words.
...I stank, didn't I?
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
...I wanted to make you happy.
I speak to you on ze phone, non? You have a special interest in music?
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!
...I didn't recognize you without the smock. Did I--damn--did I leave something at the shop?
You got the dough?!
...You bring a check?
...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh--
...That's quite a wife you got there.
...You know... who *who* is?
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
Please, Ed.
...Dave?
...It ruined me. This money. No annex. I'm all shot to hell.
...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm *prohibited* from telling you this. I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, either. I don't exactly know.  But if *I* were the man, I'd want to be told.
...Hell, I hope I've done the right thing.
...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money?
...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
...What's so damn strange about that?
Should I... should I tell you why?
How did you get into the store?
...Did Big Dave mention that it was something about his war service? I don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; I'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to *you* to help him out of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch!
...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women...
'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender.
Taking it seriously.
Coffee, Ed?
...Probity.
Yeah.
...Ed?
...You sure, Eddie?
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!
I don't understand.
His eyes are open.
What'd he say? Does he understand?
Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr. Cuthbert.
I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast.  I think you should call it off.
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.
I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
Forget it!
For Chrissake, I'll do it.  What's the combination?!
This huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, Lieutenant.  You'll just scare people off.  I can handle the security behind scenes with this system.  It's state of the art.
In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.
I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
We need light in here, stat.
An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I have a copy of this in my office at home.
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
If you don't mind, this could be important.
I've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than "the dog ate my homework".
I think I should come with you.
This place is a maze.
Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?
It's still back there!
How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
I hope you liked it.
Curious.  There's something missing.
With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.
Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator.
This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
Margo, these aren't seed pods.
"Nocturnal.  External hair and bony plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight.  "External mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust.  Aggressiveness: extreme."
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
I'm coming with you.
Come back and get me.
How many storage areas are there?
Something tried to get into this room!
Margo, this is too dangerous.  You always think you can solve everything.  This time you don't have enough information.  The animal might behave in unexpected ways.  Leave her here with me.  Don't put her in danger.
What's that?
I don't want to go this way.
And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
They were yellow!
Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded.
If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.
For once I'm glad you're rumor central.  What in the world is going on?
Mbwun.
What kind of egg is it?
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.
Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first.
I don't understand.
What happened?
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
Is there another way around?
It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?
You smell that?
I don't believe it.
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?
I thought you were in a hurry.
You want to book the flight?
I'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.
Let's talk ratings.  "Truman" has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few days--how do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself?
We should remind viewers that Truman, especially as a child, presented a challenge for the production.
That's correct.
Why do you feel that Truman's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world?
Lauren, right?
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
No.
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.
It's beautiful!  What are you waiting for?
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.
It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.  You can't just up and go.  Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that.  I've just got to move slow.  Pick my moment.  Bonus time's just around the corner.  Soon as I finish the...
You really think it could've dropped off an airliner?
It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.
No.
I went all over but I never found a place like this.  Look at that sunset, Truman.  It's perfect.
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>...  ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?
What's that?
Well, what do you think?
Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a "Chef's-Mate."  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.
It'd be an adventure.
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
Truman, what about that sign?
What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!
You got it.
--And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore."
--It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
Poopy day?
Why don't you go home to the old lady --
I need your clothes, Byers.
I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence --
No, they don't.
We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen.
This man's still alive.
Feds are looking for him, too.  Real nice business he's got, huh?
I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.
Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --
You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
I think you're full of shit.
What killed those men?
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
How can I reach you?
You found something?
Mulder -- it's me --
No. I haven't.
Jesus, Mulder...
Where are you, Mulder?
Something's not right...
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
What? What are you talking about?
I wake you?
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?
And you've never seen anything like that?
Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
What are my choices?
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
Yeah, well they may this one.
It may be extraterrestrial.
Been where?
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --
I have. I did. It's done.
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately.
You don't see what's going on here, do you?  There's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. No suspects have been named. So the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. That the FBI didn't do its job.
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
Our vaccine may have no effect!
Did we go sailing?
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
What if he wasn't like this?  What if he was "normal?"  Conscious.  How far would you go?
Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some "troubled kid" you're dealing with.
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
I read about a woman in TExas who was in a coma for seven years.  Every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster.  Isn't that something?  I don't know what name scientists have for something like that...
With Stargher I saw things...
What about Julia?
This is Stargher we're talking about?
A child can experience abuse worse than Charlie's.  And grow up to be someone who would never, ever hurt another living thing.
Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one.  Nothing else matters.  Find out where she is.
Where the hell are we?
You sure about this?
He's mine?
Already there.
Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
Is she alright?
So?
You sure you want to go through with this?
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.
His own doctor?
What's she talking about?
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
Do I...
When...what did you do?
...to steal my girl.
Are you going, too?
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
Yes.
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
How will I know you?
Please keep this passport to yourself, until I make some inquiries, will you, Major?
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
Listen, Callaghan.
...expense.
And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
Miss Schmidt.
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
Well?
It wouldn't work.
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
Wait a minute - let me out.
Be sensible, Martins.
Write her out a receipt, Paine. Give her a receipt for these letters too.
...of Santa Fe."
Shall I go over there, sir?
Do you know his number?
Come upstairs a moment.
...this lecture business, you'll put me up here a while?
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.
Well, yes. I suppose that is what I meant to say.
Striptease, sir.
Hmm.
Unwise, Holly...
What do you want me to do?
You told them, didn't you?
...you know and all that.
Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins.
Are you mad?
Baron Kurtz.
...Popescu...
Sehen sie da gleich da unter. Da unten ist est passiert. Passiert - English.
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
I was told that he did not die at once.
...give evidence.
Kurtz.
I have no evidence. I saw nothing. I said nothing. It's not my business.
Something wrong.
Third Man.
Lime.  Harry Lime.
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.
Big?
He tried to borrow money from us.
Did you sleep well?
Have you told someone?
I think so too.
No one follows that midrash.
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
What's a fascist?
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
What do you think you're doing?
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.
What, do you like it here?
This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
"...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>..."
Your father??
I want to learn to read it.
Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.
See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing?
What's it about?
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
What...? You think I'm Jewish?
Nazis talk about it all the time.
You want a punch in the mouth?
No. What are you looking for?
Carla?... It's me, Danny...Danny Balint...? We met at that...[meeting at your house.]
Who's Eichmann?
Why are you taking that?
Danny, the night we met, you said the name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the air.
More cultural than political.
That would be a catastrophic mistake.
We want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream: works like <i>The Bell Curve</i>, <i>Sociobiology</i>, anti-Zionism, anti- immigration, the com-munitarian issue.... We'll hold conferences: invite liberals, blacks, Jews. Chomsky, Cockburn, Stanley Crouch, Shahack....
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well....
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
And? WHat did you notice?
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last week you went to a Torah study group.
I thought you hated Torah.
Tell me about Lina Moebius.
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
So are you... But they'll believe you....  Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house.  Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?
You shut up. Who do you think you are?
How did you get the fucking number?
We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
He's going to die.  He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around.  I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.
Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear that thing?... You know what it means? To your people...
Which was his room?
That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal.
Which one were you aiming at?
This will be a different kind of device.
Not too fast.
Who'd you kill?
It's Friday....
Leary?
Howard Stern.
He's shy, not like Enzo.
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
Are you going to keep it?
Does he know?
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
You're leaving?
Did you tell him?
This is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete.  Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.
Did the driver really freeze?
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
The Italian, I presume?
Where did you two meet?
I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
The Mamma's there too.
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
How did it happen?
Dollars.
Roberto?  How long?
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
It isn't lit yet.
And... does the voice come back?
I don't have one.
Well, what are they?
Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
Your mother?
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
Two years younger than you.
Good night.
... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name!  Let me tell you, time erases everything!
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
Anybody can have a bad day!
Tea... or whiskey?
But what brought you to Sicily?
Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!
... No?
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
How are you?
Then, tell me a story.
Do you know how it is?  Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
I'm being a pain, huh?
And you?
What?
Why?
You've got to tell me what happened?
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
Assassin!
In my apartment?
Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled.
Well?
How was your trip?
I thought you said he was Peruvian?
Does that have a hidden meaning?
What are they for?
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
There won't be any need for that sir.
Mr. Jefferson Carver?
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
That got annoying fairly quickly.
Want to get a drink?
I want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons. Little Abraham will go to Stanford for college, Batya will go Ivy League, maybe Vassar.
Your mother was right. You do work too hard.
What are you doing here?
You two know each other?
You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail...
It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.
Hammer, you alright?
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.
What's going on? Why'd he stop?
My soninlaw. What do you think of him?
Why do you ask so many questions? What difference does it make how Carlos and I feel? Feeling does not buy clothes and houses!
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -
Sure.
Sure, I like my leopards
It's a blackcard and bad card, but not the card of the cat - not the card of fourfooted things.
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.
And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.
Oh, dear -- I don't know what I'm going to do without you - honestly, I don't 
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life - and I still don't know what the Procession means.
Well, I'd best be off.
There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
It could be a man.
Some crazy guy.
Yes, but what sort of a man?
You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --
Tell me.
Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?
I've disturbed	you. I'm sorry -
Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.
State hunters?
That's a fact, isn't it?
You won't go to Galbraith with me?
That's easy. Me.
Are you all right?
Suppose I slip them a few bucks  for the funeral expenses.
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to softsoap twenty editors!
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
Why do you want to stay around here? It'll only make you feel badly.
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
Kiki?
It's a lovely town - it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
That might depend on where youre going.
Three weeks ago. To borrow money. I wasnt here but he got to my husband, sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made. Carlos handed over 1,000 to get rid of him.
Can it be that easy?
I found this at your brothers.
I cant tell you that yet. But hes being well looked after.
Get out of my house. Youre fired, Mr Lombard.
Im impressed. That information could have cost me 20,000.
Minimizes the risks. Children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses. These can also be used to move women and drugs... Anything that makes money really.
You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. Ill give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...
Mr Lombard...
Huh! Dont you recall convincing me he had?  You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.
How... When did you...
Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?
Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins?
One just doesnt... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
Five years of it. Surely, youd have divorced him if he disgusted you?
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed?
Something like that?
To get me killed...?
Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brothers not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will...
What do you suggest?
Why the hell couldnt you divorce the man?
Directory enquiries. Can I help you?
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
Im sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
The word for those things is croissants.
May I ask where youre from, Mr Lamont?
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why cant you go back there?
By your Austrian?
You dont know why hes come to Los Angeles?  The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassys out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
Get a pen and dont ask any questions.
Some Italian I picked up back there. Hes in the boot of the Mustang.
Im finished here and Im tired, Emily. You shouldnt be here. Now dont make it worse.
Shit! Fuck! Whats fucking wrong with people!  Im going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 
Youre not playing with little boys now, scumbag. Where is the Austrian?
Where?
And who does Friedman work for?
Ive got work tonight, Jane.
I came to feed your fish. I didnt know...
Carlos De Moraes?
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
I take it your son is called Leon?
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
Look at it this way. He might achieve everything your son never did.
Problems?
Where is Friedman?
Is this Friedman?
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. Youve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name hes using?
The Hyatt...? Whats that?
At what time will you be available?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
Im sorry...
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
Thats what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldnt take on another child, that hed get into trouble... I mean, people who sell children... But he wasnt listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think hes back on drugs, eh?  Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self-destruct phase, you know?  Things to come to terms with. Demons to fight... Some peoples minds are gloriously uncomplicated. Not Leons. He did beat the drug, though. He did.
Yeah... But he didnt beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parents leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. If Leons Austrian was looking for you I reckon hed have found you before I did.
Whats the date?
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Barstows 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever youre heading, I reckon somebodyll pick you up.
Welcome to the club.
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You dont know Leon, do you?
Alors?
Gluck.
Youre the lantern man, huh?  If you wanna see whats left of him...
Why did you kill Friedman?
Are you telling me Friedman didnt tell you I was here looking for him?
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
Jeanne...!  Are you alright?
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
I will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
Will you at least let me stay with you?
... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
Didn't you also carry a banner?
W-w-what are you doing?!
Arrest them!
I understand your impatience, but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and...
It is not for us to burn her, my lord.  That is your prerogative.
Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move!
So... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you're allowed to tell us that much?
I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
Don't worry, Charles.  If God is still with her, she will be victorious.  We're not her judges... we're just spectators.  Let her go to Compiegne, as you let her go to Orleans, and let God decide her fate.
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
... and what... what did he say?
She pretends she's been sent by God! These charlatans -- it's a pity there isn't enough wood to burn them all!
Not exactly.  She wants you to give her an army -- at your expanse.  Bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury, I fail to see how you can afford such an adventure.
My captains have sworn their support.
He's probably right -- let's call a delay...
I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?
5,000 gold crowns.
It's coming -- I rode on ahead.  I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.
And... what does Jeanne think?
Do you know how to count?
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?
Did your voice tell you to jump?
Besides, what about these...?
Prepare these as battering-rams!
You don't believe me anymore?
How many did he give you?
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
That's too easy.  One minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
What signs?
I'm not lying, I... I can't remember... leave me alone!
Stop, stop... I can't remember!  The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...
Yes... yes!  And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  Why didn't he?
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
"Let all who love me follow me"... Where does God get mentioned?  Come on Jeanne, be honest.  You fought for yourself, in your name.
I -- I cleaned up my room, look... and I said my prayers... all of them... and...
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
My father's.
Oh yes... very.
Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
Him?
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
Only God knows the answer to that.
I don't want to wait for his call.
A beauty. Who is she?
I'm going to get a doctor.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
Really?
Don't worry, it won't last long.
I need help.
How long have you been married?
Will I still be able to play?
Let me see this.
Must feel better this side of the wall.
We're recruiting.
The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.
What's this about?
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
They bombed us, we're off the air.
A good place for what?  He's insane!
That's better than yesterday.
Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
But I want to help, I want to.
Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.  That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.
I thought you'd be off on tour, playing London, Paris, New York?
Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
They're going to start the final resettlement now. We know what it means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. A good man. His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw. He got to Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned empty. No transports of food are ever seen on that line. And civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station. They're exterminating us. Won't take them long. We're sixty thousand left. Out of half a million. Mostly young people. And this time we're going to fight. We're in good shape. We're organised. We're prepared.
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
Out of Warsaw.
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.
We have just come from George Banes' and they have taken him over. It is no wonder he is leaving, he has got in too deep with the natives. They sit on his floor as proud as Kings, but without a shred of manners.
Which mountains are those dear?
Ohhh I've never been there. 
One day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch... And at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb! She- never-spoke-another-word.
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.
I'll have to come and hear you play. what do you play.
You don't want to learn.
Has Ada ever spoken to you?
No, words. You have never heard words?
Please take us to the beach where we landed.
She wants to see what you can do.
Everyone has to practice.
What did she say?
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
Nobody.  I just know what kinda women he likes.  I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.
7 to 2.  That ain't bad.
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
Twist, you know this guy?
You're late.  Where you been?
You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
We'll put Salino on it.  I need somebody careful.
Granger, this is Combs.  Why haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody else is in.
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.
We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.
I thought you blew all your money.
What the hell you gonna do when Snyder rushes his finger right to Lonnegan?  You're committin' suicide, kid.
All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand.  That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand.  I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though.
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?
Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side.
Everything go all right?
No signs of trouble?
How 'bout Lonnegan?
You think he'll show?
You wanta wait for your share?
We'll use the wire.  Never known a gambler who wouldn't like to beat the ponies.
All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.
Looks like he's sulking.
What's the problem?
Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.
You in?
Raise 300.
Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan.
I can't lay that off in time.  We lose a bet that big, it could break us.
She coulda killed me last night.
I'm sorry, really I am, but my train leaves in ten minutes.
What does this guy want?
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
I don't even know you.
Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.  How does he do it?
Get on with it then.
You really picked a winner, kid.
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
What happened?
Tell your friend I'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow. We'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better.  And make sure I can get to that window this time.
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
You got nothin' on me.
Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here.  All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird.  No questions, no court appearance, nothing.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money.  We risk our whole operation for nothing.  I'll say when we make our bets.
Well we do.  He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian.
Why not?
Then just say he was sixty years old.
What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry....  What is it?
Why did that man want to kill him?
What?
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
And don't ever try to see me again.
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
What is it? Has he found him?
That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?
You hand that over to the police.
Did he tell you where he was going?
He didn't do it -- Nick!
How did you ever remember me?
Your father?
I just wanted to relieve your mind. Your father's alive and all right.
You heard about Julia Wolf?
Why... in the heart.
She... she fell over backwards.
Where did you get this gun?
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at the Public Library.  Where were you?
How'd you people happen to pop in?
Yes.  I might not have been shot.
I never saw him before.
Ask him.  I don't know.
Not without a warrant.
Who's is it?
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
What about Jorgensen?
Trail him!  Trail who?
Just rolled them up and threw them in.
Shut up.
That's all right.  Well, we'll be going.
What kind of clothes was he wearing?
Mr. Guild means guests!  Oh, there are two more to come.
I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant.  Maybe I was over at Charlie's shooting pool. Maybe I was here.  She'd remember.
Why, you said...
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
I got word from Wynant this morning...
It might.
But it must have been Wynant.  I should have known if it weren't his voice.
I have no right to answer that.
Oh, Nick... Nick!
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
Where's Gilbert?
You did... where?
Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!  Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
What's that?
Morelli -  You knew Julia.  Was she gypping Wynant?
What am I?  The fall guy?
Who is she?
What hit me?
Come on -- relax --  Give them a drink.
I'd better order some food.  That sounds like an interesting case.  Wouldn't you like to take it?
Where did you get that?
No thanks.
She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
But it's Christmas now.
I wish that doctor'd come.  How do you feel?
Aren't you hot in that?
Did I give it to you?
What's the trouble, Asta?  Your balloon busted?  So's mine.
Why don't you?
I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick?  He must be in New York....  Where do you think you're going?
He's just been for a walk.
What's that?  What are you up to?  Nickie - what is this?
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
Nick!
Wynant's body?
How long has he been dead?
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, do you think one of them did it?
Why are you saying it?
How did you get in here?
Trying to put it off on her?
You can save that and tell it to the police.  They'll be here in a minute.
I'm sorry.  Tanner, don't you want some wine?
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
I just wanted to tell you...
Who fired you?
You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
Turn the car around.
Like learning Arabic?  You're gonna learn Arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here.
What's it say?
Yeah!  Welcome to beautiful Iraq.  Land of enchantment and riches.
Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.
What are we going to do!?
He's not so--
We've got rope?
Should be easy going from here.  Stay on the pass straight to the dot.
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
Missile!
What about it?
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.
We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger are AWOL.  We have no authority--
No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.
Wes--
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
You all want to lay off?  God.  I hope the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.
They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.
It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all right.
You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?
It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight.  I told you to check for damage.
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
SAY IT!
I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.
What!?
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
It's a mine, isn't it?
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
My leg is falling asleep.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
This.  Whatever it is.
You're not losing trust, are you?
They're doing more than slapping.
Where is it?  Where'd it go?
Where the hell is it!?
If they land--
It looks like you're not doing anything.
It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And it's heavier than I imagined.
He's not going to leave us.
Why do I have to stay down here?
All right.  You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow.
Wes might be right about that.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
What if he's not?
No.
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
And you; you've got it all together.
Getting cold.
Just let me rest for a second.
Well?
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
Oh, God...
Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!
An Iraqi?
Is that good, or bad?
Why haven't they killed us!?
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
...Wes...?
Can you ride a horse?
Why do I have to lie in the road?
This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...
I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.
When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?
What does that mean?
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
That's in two days.
They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--
We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
You ever think about it?  You ever worry?
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?
This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
Is there anything you do know?
We're American soldiers.  We don't abandon people.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
You down?
Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
Maybe we should give him some water.
Hurry up.
What's this?  Why did you change it?
I don't know.
Then why did you bring it up?
What time is it?
I said what time is it?  How long was I out?
What do you think you're doing? You're going to get us arrested.
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.
They know.  They've been watching us.  I can feel it.
It's the end.
Who?  Who's leaving?
How far did you go?  Was it cold?
I'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though.  I haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled... 
What's going on?
Where's LUH?
What are you doing here?
...and you're not lost now?
Who?  Me?...I don't know.
Oh, That!  I'm 5555 SRT Entron..
Remember this...?
Yes.
....I'm taking SP5, but it doesn't seem strong enough.  I have a hard time concentrating.  Please forgive me, I slipped on....
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
Coffee, Mike?
Where did you get this?
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
This is where the van was parked.
You guys seem pretty tight.
Why do you do it?
How do you know?
Should we head for the Interstate?
Glass, what is it?
Lane oil...
Jesus...
What is that?
Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.
He is!
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
Oh shit...
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.
It don't work-
P.E.T.N ...
Sir...
What's this?
It's our only option.
Yes.
Pardon me, m'sieu. Madame Colet would like to see you in the living room.
still studying the vase. Mariette appears. He turns to her.
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
The representative of the police wants to know how much money you had, M'sieu Filiba.
Why did you let this man in, M'sieu Filiba?
<u>Tonsili!</u>
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
No.
You're looking fine, Major.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
Yes, Baron.
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
I want to see-- 
And as for you, waiter--
Two weeks and three days.
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
Yes, m'sieu.
Very well, m'sieu.
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
Thank you!
We'll go to Venice, to the same hotel!
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!
Correct. Now the train leaves--
Are you insane? You've to get out of here at once! She may come back any minute.
Yes...?
You know the main staircase in the opera?
Then you go into the foyer.
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
One purse--  empty. One vanity case-- 
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
Goodbye, M'sieu La-- Oh, yes ... This is a rather delicate matter and I don't want to ... You see, if you read my advertisement carefully, you must have noticed that there was ...
Yes.
And do you know what I'd like to have you do with that check?
Eighteenth century.
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
Oh? 
But, madame, you keep a hundred thousand francs--in your safe--at <u>home</u>?
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
I'll be delighted.
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
Good night. 
Precisely.
No--yours, madame.
Yes, I would!
Like that!
And you're going to fall for them.
Yes, Gaston?
It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn't it?
It could have been marvelous ...
Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.
Lovely.
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
No, he <u>works</u> too much.  He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--
Right!
I think you'd better go.
No--I'm sorry.
How much time?
You know I don't like that, Rose.
I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
Something serious has happened.
But I was with him the whole time.
You're precious to me, Rose.
This should be amusing.
There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.
You know somebody?
I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men back there! We got plenty a' room for more.
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
And...?
I don't know the steps.
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
Fabrizio said you might be up --
What is it? A sapphire?
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.
It's getting quiet.
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
I'm sorry.
Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond.
It's been 84 years...
Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after that?
Rose, get in the boat!
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
Oh--a hundred times--
Good afternoon--
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
Isn't she lovely?
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
Aces full.
You're coming back--
Nice lines--
This is great. I'll be able to watch your act every night.
Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.
You know, you're not a <U>bad</U>-looking girl. In fact--I think you're lovely.
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
Good night, Mrs. Brett!
I could see you were pining away--
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
Well, I'll be--!!!
We coulda got two third-class!
Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
A dollar forty.
My change.
Shortie!--you know my motto?
They won't squawk--they're professionals.
Thank you, sir. 
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
You keep it-- 
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
How's your mother feeling?
Care to join us?
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?
You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
Here's your fifty.
That's all right. I'll attend to this.
I don't know what it is, but I won't use it.  Is she entertaining you?
Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?
What?
Hello, Denby!
Come on, get up.  That horse is carrying too much of a load.
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
I didn't--
Are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo--  Get out of here. 
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
Yes.
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
Very good, Mary--
What's the matter, Mary?
When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
Well, he has a straw hat--
--And he has sex appeal.
H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
That's him! That's the sucker!!
He's all right.
I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--
Congratulations.
He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.
There you are, sir.
I'll explain later--
Nothin'.
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Skinny lunger, your guns don't Impress me.  Wasn't for those guns You'd be nothin'.
Look, I don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and I mean to have him back.  One way Or another.
Hey, you smell that?  Smells like Something died.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me.  Good day.
Ecentus stultorum magister.
On three?  You call it.
All right, lunger.  Let's do it.
Here, Doc.
I calculate that's the end of This town.  And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling.
You don't even know him.
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
I see.  And what would you do if "she" walked in her right now? WYATT "She"?
I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!
So what does he want?
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.
You know, Stephen Foster.  "Oh, Susanna".  "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!
Don't touch me!
Are you out of your mind?  What on Earth'd make us-
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.
You know, we might just pull this off.
Hey Creek, you ever see anything Like that before?
We've never actually met.  My Name's-
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
I have nothing left.  I have Nothing to give you.  I have no Pride, no dignity, no money.  I Don't even know how we'll make a Living.  But I promise I'll love You every second of your life.
Milt Joyce, owner-operator.
Come up to the fire, honey.
No, stay.  Please stay with me.
Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.
Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?
Really?  You sure?
All right, look.  I can make it Right, I can make this up to you, Mattie.  I can, I swear.
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
So what about you Cowboys anyway?
Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done...
Florentino!  He's getting away!
Next waterhole's Black Draw.  We Could be there by mid-morning.
I don't like it.
Well what do you think happens When you die?
You were right.  It's nothin' like I thought.  I almost wish...
Get down, boy.
That a fact?
Go ahead.  Skin it.  Skin that Smoke wagon and see what happens.
Look pretty rough.
Keep your eye on that brass ring. Don't let anything side-track you.
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
Here they are again.  Look at 'em.
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
Why don't you just leave it alone?
Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour.  For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago -
At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
You see, Mr. Bond, you and I are both men of action. But your era is passing. Words are the new weapons; satellites the new artillery. And make no mistake about it: In the right hands, they can be as deadly as your Walther PPK.
Briefly.
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
What - no lust for adventure?
Oh, James. I've missed you -
Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?
Do you feel better now?
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much time to demonstrate your new Q toys.
Gone fishing.
It was an authorized test. I returned the money.
A wedding band??? What am I supposed to be able to do with this?
What do you want with the Harbor Master?
Can you arrange a meeting?
Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred -  What happened?
They point, I shoot.
Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.
Boyfriend?
Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
- Shut up!
I hope you'll be gentle.
Why don't we just take these -
... Do you have a gun?
He's killed closer.
Wait here.
... How did you get into marine salvage?
Sometimes you just have to -
Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
Another reason??? Did I miss something???
Sleep well?
And number two?
...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.
... And what do you call these?
You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
What's your name?
I was an attorney!
A dead head.  Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west.  Muncy! Engines to half!
That was too close.
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
Bore through.  ...They used to say living well was the best revenge, Mr. Bond.  They're wrong.  Revenge is the best revenge.
Take the men. I can finish alone.
Is the helicopter ready?
- Built to withstand a nuclear blast.  Are they alive?
What the hell is going on?
Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.
What about ID's?
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
I'm cold. I need to get out into the sunlight.
Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?
It was nip and tuck.
What is that?
Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.
You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
Since this morning.
This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child.
I came all the way from Detroit by bus going to Oakland. The bus stopped in Los Angeles. I had to get off and take a rest. I'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight. I'm just too tired to go on.
Good morning.
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
You know the saying, "your heart is in your left hand."
An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you, tappy head, you ain't worth the salt you put in greens.
I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago.
You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
Where is Skip?
I didn't mean for you to pay me for that.
Can I bring some toys?
Here!  In the car!
Which one can I open first?
Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
What's going on?
I could have stopped him.
My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
Oh, I'm a sham!!
Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
It's not a laser!  It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
Something's screwy here.
What?
I dunno.
Hey!!
No she's NOT --
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
That ain't no happy child.
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!
Did you all take stupid pills this morning?!  Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?  And now you want to let him back over here?
No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!
Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.  This is serious!!
They're getting bigger.
Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
Mission accomplished.  Well done, men.  Pack it up, we're going home.
Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
Reach for the sky!!
Hey, Slinky?
Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
You'll put your clothes here.
Mummy was scared of him, I think. He went to her wedding but he was <i>furious</i>, you can see it in the photograph.
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
Who's there?
Finn ...
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.
I'm Melanie.
You're well built; how old are you?
One thing bothers me...  That kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him.  Serious amounts.  He's lucky he lived.  So I gotta ask: what's your daughter on?
He's not here.
What?  What is it?
What is he planning on telling them?
If Manolo hadn't gone and told them what he did then Salazar and Madrigal would never have been brought to justice.  He did a great thing for Tijuana.  He did a great thing for Mexico.
Helena, I'm so sorry --
I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good.
Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
Helena, please.  This is out of your hands.
Helena --
Did you get it?
It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too hard.
So my wife is lying?
Like a Grateful Dead Concert.
Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
How long have you known?
You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.
If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.
About the other night, I'm sorry.
He didn't hang around us.  He's like one of those hippie kids.  I'm not part of that group.  It was a party in all these rooms.  His girlfriend who I barely know was completely hysterical... He's blue, he's puking... We didn't want to get in trouble, but what were we supposed to do?  I mean, what would you have done if you had been us?
What if every country legalized at the same time?
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".
...How old are you?
Private?
You do?  What else you do?
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
You know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day?  He and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to seven, set your clock, two bourbons --
Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy?
I have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.
She knows Arnie Metzger.
I'll put this in the back.
Women's room, stall two.  Should we stop for ice-cream?
You may speak.
I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
He hired you.  That was a mistake.
My husband had been working on something he called, The Project for the Children.  Are you aware of this?
Every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine.  Odorless. Undetectable by dogs.  Undetectable by anyone.
That's good coke.
A group of us are going out tonight.
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
Somewhere safe.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
The cocaine brand, 911, is an East Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, and you must know it usually comes through into El Paso?
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
My work keeps me young.
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
I got money.
She's not at that place you sent her?
I just want to be clear about one thing.  I used to work for him, but now I work for you.  I'm not a partisan person, I'm an issue person. In the next few weeks, if you allow me, we'll get you well-versed on an incredible array of issues.  The most important of which, in my opinion, being Mexico.  I know everybody that you're gonna meet. It's important that they like you. It's not important that they like me.  That's why I can help protect you.
Salazar's been taken down.  He was working for Porfirio Madrigal.
What do we do?  Okay.  Fucked-up Bowman's turning blue.  Doctor.  We need a doctor.
Did you tell him?
Well, I've not brought them.
Twenty thousand.
What?
I'm no a fucking buftie and that's the end of it.
Sorry.
Christ, I haven't felt that good since Archie Gemmill scored against Holland in 1978.
Holding hands?
Yes.
Well, it isn't.
You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.
Tommy knew he had the virus, like, but never knew he'd gone full-blown.
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Thank you, Mr. Murphy. We'll let you know.
I'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now.
There's no need.
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got heroin?
Running time?
It's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life.
Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
Cut it out.
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
Why would I want to sell my passport?
How much?
That's tough.
What's on the menu this evening?
Sounds great, Swanney.
You'll have to send us a postcard.
There.
How long is it?
Six weeks and no sex?
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
A walk.
What do you see as your main strengths?
Homeless people?
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
It could. Yes.
Admit it. We're lost.
New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
Shuttle en route.
Your pain runs deep.
Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push.
Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.
Oh, God
Oh. I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong.
Jim.
Goodnight, Spock.
What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.
Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.
Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear.
Their equipment is primitive but effective. I recommend we land at Coordinate 8563.
To land any closer would risk detection.
Spock.
How do you know?
I believe I have found a faster way.
Spock... don't.
What are you doing?
No special conditions?

Borgus Frat.
I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
Easy, easy,  easy, Scotty. Easy. You're back with us.
No, no, no. Scotty - Scotty... There's so much I want to tell you.
Spock?
Sybok.
Sybok, we must find a way...
I don't get it.
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
Want one?
Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.
Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
Did you say Group 7 access?
I want to go to his place.
Beautiful!
They'll start to soon enough.
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
I'm your program?
I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
Yes?
Well I want to communicate --
Well, isn't it -- ?
What's that?
Flynn!!
But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan ...
Then...
Boy the view from up here... you know the territory?
The MCP blasted it... There are very few domains left with any power at all.
Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?
It's all circuits...  Must be an input/output component...
Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap?
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
You think we can make it there?
I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...
How?
I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something.
Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
Can you cover me for an hour?
I'm done.
Dana, Mr. Hardy called.  Why weren't you in class today?
Faisil.  You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?
Probably because it sounds scary.				*
Harry!  Where are you!
What?  It's on the way.  She says she's got something for me.
Abu Kaleem Malik.
Goddamnit, Harry.  This is our butts.  So your life is in the toilet.  So your wife is banging a used car salesman.  Sure it's humiliating.  But be a man here--
He's got it.
Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?
My husband is a good man.
Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.
Hi, honey.  How was the flight?
I'm late.
I need you to talk to Dana.  The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon.
Look, I know you're upset.  I'm really sorry, honey.  I raced home as quick--
I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.
I thought we might have lunch tomorrow.
How long have you been a member of his faction?
Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker.
Would you say he was boring, then?
This Simon.  Did you sleep with him?
I can do it!
Natasha?
No.  But I wanted to.
What are you going to do?
It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.
Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
You working on someone right now?
Sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then?
Beat it.
Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?
Like one?
Worse than Cairo?							*
Did you read the papers yesterday?
Were they trying to kill you?					*
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
Who is this woman?
Did you get the letter?
Let me speak to Clarence.
I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs.
I didn't get any chicken.
Bye-bye.
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
Great movie. Action-packed!
Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.
Ask me them again. One by one.
I don't remember.
Burt Reynolds.
What are your turn-ons?
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.
Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
You mean she got a bad batch?
Did you hurt yourself?  Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
"Heroes For Sale"?
Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?
Did ya ever see "The Chinese Professionals"?
Sweetheart, write down your former address.
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?
Do you want some wine, sweetheart?
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports.
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
Ain't no man have to eat pussy!
If I thought I could get away with it -
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
Who the fuck are you?
Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.
Wannabee nigger...
Clarence?
It's great to hear from you.
You comin' to L.A.? When?
Alabama, could you tell Clar -
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
How much of that letter was on the up and up?
But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set.
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
What's this acting class guy's name?
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.
I got the part on "T.J. Hooker".
They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning.
Now's a helluva time to play "what if".
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter".
Leave the gorillas.
Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're dependable. And, they're safe.
Where's everybody else?
Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
Come again?
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?
You and Robin moved?
Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.  And what you're trying to do is get him off.  Whenever you're ready.
Could we try it now?
Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.
Nicholson and I.
I'll keep lover boy here entertained.  You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her suck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's done it before. But I want you as a audience.  Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?
Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!
Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?
Sorta room-mates?
Yes.
He's drugged out of his mind!  He's completely zoned out.
We're very close!  Because of you!
It's important to observe everything.
They forced me to take drugs.
What kind of information?
You're afraid of germs?
July.
Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
What do you mean -- when you were a kid?
They're keeping an eye on me.
I told you what I want.  Lock the door!
All I see are dead people.  Everywhere. What's three more?
Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?
The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax?
What does this mean to you?
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
You... you couldn't have heard me.
I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
That's what they were up to!  Freeing animals!
I know this place! ... This is my dream.
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?
They hurt you!
Look at those assholes, they're asking for it!  Maybe people deserved to be wiped out!
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.  I am a new person!  I'm completely adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.  Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
He was fully sedated!
What...virus?
-- so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses. Totally irrational, totally disoriented, doesn't know where he is, what day it is, alla that stuff.  All they got was his name.  They figure he's stoned out of his mind, it's some kinda psychotic episode, so they're gonna bring him...
You have him in restraints.
That would explain the bruises, I guess.  The struggle.
Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
Oh, Jesus.
You don't fear death?
Thirty-bucks?  That's it?
Hundred and eight ain't a hundred and thirteen.
Where to?
Somewhere else?  Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?
Hey!
Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
Nothing.
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!
What the hell . . . oh it's you. Might've figured.  What do you want?
What would a truck stop be without beer?
No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Ned!  Now look at what you done! Are you all right?
For the love of God would you two give it a rest?  Lord almighty.  In all my years I have never seen anything so pathetic.  How far did you think you were going to get with this?  Neither one of you can wait to slit the others throat.  Now use what little smarts you got.  If I was going to bust you I wouldn't have waited until after you killed Jake.
. . .at the very least.  I know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars.  Now, how much did you get?
Do you have to call me that?
No, I've got it.
It's very nice of you to help me. That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
Least you can leave.
You've been around.
Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
What do you do anyway?
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
Doesn't the heat bother you?
Jake.
He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
Lied?  What do you mean?
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
Where's the safe?
To get my car.
John!?  What the hell's the matter with you?
Sheriff Potter, please.  I can't go to jail.  I wanted no part of it.
Well, nothing.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
It's . . . it's locked.
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.
Someone will find me.
Who the hell are you?
You've got to be--
I'm a solid man.
Where you headed?
Live there?
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
Another accident?  You've really got to be more careful.  Can I get you a drink?
I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
Now what can I do for you?
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
Shut up.
Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?
I came for Grace.
I came to kill her.
You're right.  I don't give a damn about her.  But to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  That just makes a fool out of him.  I don't like being made a fool of.
I asked you a question.
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter?
What happened to your hand?
Got any requests?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
I wasn't doing anything.
Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
Christ, I don't believe this.
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up, and then . . . and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
Now, what's this?
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
Why don't you step out of the car, son?
That's what this is all about?  A shakedown?  You picked the wrong people.  We don't have any money.
No police.
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Maybe I do.
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm stompin' your ass.
Who the hell is this!?
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
A lot that means.
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Wait a second--
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the juke?
What happened to your hand?
Got any requests?
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
You want to take a look at my car?  I think the radiator hose is--
Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through."  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't worth a duck's fart . This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this .
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
Two-hundred.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty.
Yeah, but it was shot.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.
That's right on my way.
Jesus.
No, I've got it.
Where you headed?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
What do you do anyway?
A medicine man?
All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
I don't know how.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
After he got his divorce, he forced me to marry him...but when I saw her body, I swore to her on my soul that some day I'd get Jake for what he did to her...
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
What do you mean?
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?
Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?
What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
No Grace, my hand's bothering me.
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
Yeah, if you could send it care of...
One way, or round trip?
Keep your change.  Bus three-twenty-three. Leaves at seven fifty two, tonight.
Heineken?
Son of a bitch!
I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's <u>you</u>. You <u>Grace</u> or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife.... What do you way Grace?
No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
Proceed.
Once again please?
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
I don't know. It's been a while.
...I can't remember.
I remember you.
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
What about the game?
Maybe it wasn't a specific moment, maybe it--
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
What's he talking about?
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
I got you a seat in the seven hundred level.  It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
I thought he was carrying something.
I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.
He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?
You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.
No Jeremy.
What do you do if something happens?
How many did you put on that time?
I'm not scared.
What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
Was your family traveling with you?
Did you get up from your seat?
Now you're going to have to tell me more.
You and my mother would have a special connection.
There have been three major disasters in this city over the last four years. I've followed each one of them... A Seven-three-seven crashes on take off. One hundred and seventy-two die. No survivors... A hotel fire downtown. Two hundred and eleven die. No survivors... And am Amtrak train derails seven and half miles outside of the city. One hundred and thirty one die. One survivor. He is unharmed.  I've spoken with your husband about his survival. I suggested a rather unbelievable explanation. Since then, I've come to believe, that my explanation, however unbelievable, is in fact, true.
If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?
Where'd you get the money, huh?
I didn't mean no offense.  I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?
Yeah. See?
Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob.
You leave me at the mercy of my enemies.
Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
Uh... a little, maybe.
Heard you done the roof yourself.
What's all that wood?
Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
He should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend.
Duke.
First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.
A sign on him?
He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.
Maybe I ain't.
I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess.  I ain't touched a drop in ten years. My wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness.
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'...
Well, now Kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. Maybe...
Get some sleep, Kid.
Did you kill him?
What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on?
When we gonna double back?
Yeah, he's in there.
Yeah, I guess so.
That was... the first one.
First one I ever killed.
Wha... what f-for?
HEY, KID.
No.
Yeah?
Claudia... ain't here, Bill.
I seen her... I seen Claudia too...
Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together.
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
Three.
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
You was right to change your mind, Kid.
Far enough.
More.
Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
I don't kill nobody without him. 
That ain't what I mean.
&lt;&lt;No, no, no. I need a guarantee from the ridiculous man. I am going to be killed. I have seen the Devil and looked him in the eye.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Keyser Soze. Keyser Sate. I've seen his face. I see it when I close my eyes.&gt;&gt;
That's enough, Edie.
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.
Why don't you just calm down'
Me too.
How do you do?
I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things -
Don't hurt me.
They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.
What-are they speaking?
What if I
How are you, Keaton?
with what?
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
We're on vacation.
Take your time. Enjoy L.A.
A little of both.
He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him'
That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.
I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man.
According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else.
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
So this lawyer...
Do you believe in him, Verbal?
I came clean. I told it like it happened on the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It's got so many holes in it, the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal.
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.
His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.
Edie...
This is all bullshit.
Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
... tell me about this case.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... ...nothing can make the woman well...but we try to compensate...to make a gesture...
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
What are you doing here?
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
This is going to drive the ante up.
Whatever the `truth' is, let's hear that.  You were her doctor.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.  Is that correct?
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
Orthopedics?
...of Anesthesiology?
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
No further questions.
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
I am on the staff of...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
Dr. Gruber ...
I appreciate--a man as busy as--
Uh ... in the, well, in the interests of her family ... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution.  Her doctors ...
Well, well, when can we meet again. I'd like to get a deposition..
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.  If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   See my point?  Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
I had a witness disappear on me.
Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
Listen to me, fella...
Nothing further, your Honor...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
This is Miss Costello...?
I'm a lawyer.
Really.  How wonderful for you.
They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'
Maybe I can do something right.
I've got to work...
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
Well, then what are you doing here?
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
Maybe I'll tell you later.
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
Hi, Mickey ...
You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
...I have to stand up for her...
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up.
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
What happened, Joey...?
`You guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...'
Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
We got a mistrial, you know.  Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
... I understand ...
Hi.
Thank you.
Yes.
...of the procedures...
Yes.
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you?
Not what you think. We're very happily married.
How can I see her, to know her?
You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job.
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
Just let me talk to you.
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
It's a place to live, that's all.
About three years.
Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay.
Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
The color of your hair...
The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?
We're going awfully far.
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
We're going up the tower.
Yes!
When?
Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.
When you...  There were pins in my hair...
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
One shouldn't live alone.
Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
Would you like some coffee?
Good-bye.
No.
Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
Where?
Have you been here before?
Why did you jump?
No, I can't tell you!
Take me away from here?
Would you know the room?
Where?
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
Don't leave me... stay with me...
Tell me.
Go on with your dream. What was it that frightened you?
No... we're together...
Where?
Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know.
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
And there! There you see? Her key is on the rack!
Her car is gone.
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
My... the acrophobia.
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
Johnny!
Just wander.
Around.
Yeah.
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
Well...
I said how's it going?
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
Oh, and why am I an asshole?
What did you say?
Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.
You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife.
Don't even start.
One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.
What are you doing?
We have to call the ambulance.
Stop it!
Bury her out in the desert.
Her fucking head was caved in.
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
We have to get going.
Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.
Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
What?
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in!
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.
Where's the candy?
Real times.
If anything ever happens to me...
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
No way.
I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...
My god.
What?
She's in there!
I don't think so Boyd.
But not tonight.
Keith Richards, Dean Martin...
What's your fucking point?
Oh, Jesus...call the police.
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
Just do it.
My what?
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
The hell I did!
Nope.
False.
Not true.
Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
Are we supposed to?
What do you mean, you think so?
Photographer?
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
Charles Moore for instants.
I just don't see him in the big picture.
You expect more what?
Do you love me?
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
Just a bit of organizing.
Yeah. Nesting.
The chairs.
Yeah baby. Everything's great.
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.
Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay.
What are you talking about?
You fucked a prostitute?
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
He kept saying he was protected.
No...
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here.
Where did you get that?
Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".
The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me?
That ought to be about the end of that.
No...No.
Boyd...I don't know man...It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head.
Greenpeace.
There.
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
Where's the camera?
When I wasn't so miserable I used to sell pigs. Begging your pardon, I was more honest than my holy Mother.
Take me there.
You have no feelings toward ...
How did you know about that?
This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
You must think I'm mad.
If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell.
Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.
Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.
Leave me now. You can go to bed.
Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
How much is that?
Ramona! Ramona!
What's the matter with you?
So, Ramona!
What are you thinking about?
Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...
I don't know, sir.
I don't know -- they've always been there.
Miss Viridiana ...
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...
Are they going to work here too?
And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs.
Are your parents alive?
How do you do, Miss Viridiana!
Don't invent stories; go to bed.
I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.
She looks like a sick marrow!
Have I slept long?
My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate.
We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
You all right?
But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did.
... illegal search of Lindenmeyer' s duplex. Eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed. Twentyfour citizen complaints. And the calls are just starting to come in...  I forgot what it's like to have you on the streets.
I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
Barnes, where the hell have you been?!
It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  Did you find out where the bomb is?
You know how much man power you're talking about?
This better not be a wild goose chase.
Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
... and you get nanodeath.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.
He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
You catching my drift?
I am beautiful, aren't I?
You actually listen to all those tapes?
John died.
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
Go to hell.
I don't need a babysitter.
I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.  The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?
This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
Sounds to me like a welleducated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
We know you didn't kill those guards.
Can I ask you something?
That's why I'm asking.
You okay?
Where the hell are you going?
The symphony of collision...
You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!
There you go  best seat in the house.
Do they have to look so...robotic?
...on the way in.
Ames here.  <u>Yessir</u>... 
Okay.  Here's what we're gonna do.
Hey, hey, I'm just the Producer, I'm just the <u>Stationmaster</u>, Johnny Green wrote that song, and...
Mr. President, this is St...
He, uh, has he been in the "jail" long?
...where?
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.
Alright.  Look here, any of you kids hear in this room:  what you hear here, what you say here, what you <u>do</u> here, f'it got out, you leaked it.  Tell'em what they need to know.
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
We're going to have to explain away the...
It won't hold, Ronnie, it won't prove out.
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
...you want us to go to War...
What do you know about them?
...can we see the Kitten...?
Waal, that's where you <u>want</u> em...
We're bring'n im in tomorrow, five AM.
Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews...

Find out is there <u>any</u> chance we can get some rain tomorrow, <u>will</u> you...?
...this is magnificent.
And I'd like to point out that I've been on prescription <u>medication</u>, the side-effects of which...
...child at the airport...  breaks through the ranks, runs to "old shoe" -- should we have <u>flower</u> or a <u>bear</u>...?
Courage, Mom.
What about him?
Oh, MiGod.
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
...where is my pill?
ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
OVER A SLEEPING BREAN, STRETCHED OUT ON A POOLCHAIR, GRACE, THE SECRETARY, COMES OUT ON TO THE POOL AREA, HOLDING THE SHOT OF A SMALL, FOREIGN LOOKING CHILD, IN FRONT OF A PILE OF RUBBLE. SHE SHOWS IT TO MOSS.
ON BREAN AND MOSS, WHO WALK SCHUMANN ACROSS THE HIGHWAY. IN THE B.G. WE SEE AMES TALKING TO THE DRIVER OF THE HARVESTER, WHO IS A SMALL, HISPANIC MAN.
Would somebody wake me in five minutes?
Hello...?
Course there's a war.  I'm watching it on Television.
It can be documented that he displayed the...
There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber,
What do you want the kid to say?
String a few together.  All I need's eleven,
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
"They Got To Know?"  <u>Stan</u>...?  Get with it.  Who Killed Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk <u>Driver</u>.  You watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building. The <u>truth</u>, I was in the building when they <u>shot</u> that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building.
...who is this guy...?
We don't need an Act Two.
What is it?
Yeah...?
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
Against...who could be aggressor....Help me out here...Units of 303, the Defense Department confirms, early this morning, Albanian Time, stormed a mountain hideaway, near the city of -- help me out here -- and freed a tired, but happy William Schumann, Suffering no casualties.  His condition is reported as Guarded, and his route to the US has not been disclosed, but a high White House source confirms he is expected in Washington tomorrow morning...no, that's for the wire service.  Moss's working on Big Bird's Inaugural.  Nine A.M...?  Nine?  Miss the commuters, but...
Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
...the Albanian Campaign.  And we won't even be a footnote...
They should be.  Most valuable animal since Sea Biscuit.  <u>Isn't</u> he...
I thought they weren't meeting him at the airport...
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
...what happened...?
Uh huh...why?
What he went through in <u>Albania</u>...
No, I'm On Top of it...
Pals:  Get on the <u>phone</u>... r'they flying it?
You see?  What's the lesson here?  <u>Never</u> give up. <u>Never</u> give up.
Let's take the bridge from <u>nine</u>, and the intro from <u>one</u>, and...
Look, look, look, look, Canada, okay...?  Our neighbor to the North, alla sudden, transformed, into That Place, where, like the North Wind, <u>Terror</u> comes...

You like it?
Jim Belushi...?
What would be true, then.
...by you?
And one of them is in love with the <u>sister</u> of...
The hats.
With their berets...
...you're gonna Punch in a Kitten Later.
A wider option of what?
Oh, hell...
Gordon, the insurance people are balking on the logging trucks...
Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What do you want him to do?
Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.
Grand Marnier.
I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv.
Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.
You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours.
I agree. Go thou and sin no more.
Sell?
you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman.
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
...Got a 100 on me, you...
What brings you out here...
Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore, pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter, flight attendants...
Another cup of coffee?
...this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission, whatever the hell that is, calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought...
I told him I was in the bathroom and I'd call him right back. What the hell was I supposed to say Buddy, you got me into...
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.
...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.
Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management.
...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
What about hard work?
I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more.
You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
The break up value is higher. It's worth 80.
The art of which is deception. Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned...
What the hell do you want?
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.
I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.
Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
Where is it?
What if I have a previous engagement?
If I could have anything... this would almost do.
...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...
You know, the elevator man couldn't believe I paid $300,000 to have my walls looking like this, he's got them for free in Brooklyn.
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
Do you think you're ready?
Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.
Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud!
You really mean that?  What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien...
You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.
So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love?
You told him about us?
... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions. We got close to half a million shares in the bag.
Businessman?
Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
Your books Master Loftmore
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
Velcome to ve Vaxverk.
Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
Well, it all started when a friend and I
Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
Of course you will.
That was very good.
I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
He loves you very much.  He just--
I miss you.
I started seeing things.
Did you?
What?
You think that'll help?
Are you humoring me?
No.
Who are you?
You're the flower lady.
I wanted to apologize.
No.
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
Why are you here?
They're calling me in to work.
Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
He looked like one of the Monkees.
How you holding up?
You are?
Oh my god.  You bought it.
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
In the window.  Norman's at work.
Nothing's happening.
Mef?  What's Mef?
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
Something was there.  You saw it.
But Claire--
Adamant?
Jody, she tried to kill him.
I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
I guess not.
What's their name?
She's awake.
How are you?
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
You did a great job.  She's a good kid.
Did you...
Maybe we should just...
Hi.
Think I may have cracked it.
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
Our house.
Where is she then?
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
When?
Tonight?
What are you doing?
You're not at the center.
Norman...
Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.
Who did?
Do I have everything?
You know I am.
We walked all night...
You don't remember?
The...
I take it your not mad at me.
That's not what I'm sayi--
I never asked you to quit!
She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house...
How can you be sure?
Look for antiques...
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
Do you know it?
I'm cooking you dinner.
Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
I don't believe you.
Jesus I've got - to get to the ho--
No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?
Rowan.
Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair.  Your cousin.  Deedee...you'r mother and I - we - we grew up together.
Aren't they gauche...?   Those steel things are so - common.
Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -
I beg your par---
My...mother...?
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
Who the hel1 -
You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
Lasher touched you and you loved it.
Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
The wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you can control, isn't there?  The great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  Why would you hurt him...?!  Answer me.
To love, you must be able to feel.
There is no one here but the dead.
A girl...?
Do not tell me that!
--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
Only you...
Go on. Rowan.  Go on.
Oh god...
Let me go...  Michaelllllll...
Harder...
They like you ------- kids.
What do you see...?
Just one.  The bar's closed.
Harder...
What else did you see- Michael...?
He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H.  Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence.
Doctor's orders- - -?
Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU. 
Aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence -
No - I didn't kill him.   Would you rather I'd let them kill us - after they'd raped me...?
ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  But I'm on the outside now...  you put me there!
You okay...?
That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
Which do you think is her best shot...
It doesn't mention 'females only'
My mother...?  I never knew my real MOTHER - I was adopted
You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?
What was your relationship with STEPHANIE?
Yes...
I thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face...
Why did you let him in?
I don't like sugar
I don't want either of us to come to any harm - please...
You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him!
Is LESLIE here?
It's been what, three years?
I'm really very sorry - I was banking on this coming through, because it's only five minutes from my surgery...
Just put it in my room
I thought it was you - how are you?
That's good
So she didn't mention anything more about it?
I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon...
Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation...
Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.
I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe.
Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.
I can't believe that's your mother. We're talking babe-a-licious chub fest, right here in the 501's.
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
Don't tell me.  Another vision of incomparable beauty?
Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!
Get them together.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
Well. The prom's coming up.
You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!
Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.
God, you are so hot.
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
Son.
Finally, some gratitude.
Sorry I--
It's your car. These are all your cars.
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.
Teddy? I was thinking.
Ted! Do something!
Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you!
But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.
So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.
And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."
But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
Great.
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
I have to admit, I always felt... different.
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
She said peanuts, you cretin.
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
I mean my father.
You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.
He's on the move?
At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
Don't you get it? In one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue.
Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment?
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman.
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--
That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.
In a hurry, are we?
Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day.
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
How soon can we get something?
Merritt, Forensics.
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
About Suzie?
Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.
They were in me.  Both places... you know.
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
Try, Kelly.
If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour.
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.
You saw the news today?
Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
Eliminate the competition.
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
We all have...
Where's the body?
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
No.
I want a full-scale investigation.
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.
A ride.  You want one?
Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
I say something funny?
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
You are.
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
Excuse me?
The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.
Get off my property.
What?
Don't forget the car wash.
The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves...
We have to stick with the plan.
Kelly.  Is Suzie there?
I'm here.
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
Say you love me.
I'm running away.
But check this...
Nellie Gail Ranch...
There's nothing for them to get.
It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta here.
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
Sam...
I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...
Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
Limestone quarry?
All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
All that jumping and kicking.
You might have mentioned you had that.
This is good.
Oh, damn!  That's it.
Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.
What is that?
And people are actually fooled by that?
So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
It was in your book.
God in heaven, what is that?!
My God!  He's so excessive!
The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
Your private train, sir.
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
French?
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
I've even printed my own currency.
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
Willow Ufgood.
You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?
No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.
The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel.
Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
I do what I'm told.
Because it's true.
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
Don't make me angry, Peck.
I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!
Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
Fresh goat's milk.
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.
Hey!  Give me that baby!
Where's the baby??
So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.
Madmartigan, I need your help.
She's in love.
She's a bird, Willow.
Watch it!
It's not a Nelwyn baby.
Who are you!  Who are you!
How am I gonna do that?
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
But what am I gonna transform??
Ouch!!
I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it!
I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die!
Time is running out.
I'm not going in there.
Get back here, Rool!
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
She's hungry.
Ohhh, I hate this.
Hey, careful there!
Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?
Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before?
Who are these orphans, anyway?
Put my car in the garage and close the door.
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about?
Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor?
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.
Hey, Sam...
Amish.
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
They kid a lot.
Does anybody know I'm here?
How long?
How long have I been here?
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.
Where's the nearest telephone?
Well... the store at Saltzburg...  But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while.
When will you be going?
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.
I was being foolish?
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
That's God's way!
I got there late, John.
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual...
I'm coming.
You admit you're lying?
You're the first one he'll contact.
John said you're Amish.
Is the English dead?
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws 
I am not a child.
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
I don't want to stay here.
Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy!
Dorothy!
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.
Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
If she?
Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
...have you come back?
... -- Oz -- has spoken!
Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
I thought you said she was dead.
Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
Yes, I'm ready now.
Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right.  I -- you're -- you're going on a visit.  No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.
No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
Oh --
That's right.  What's she doing?
...bed.
Oh -- 
Now you're seeing reason.
Where do you want to be oiled first?
Oh --
Oh --
And him a brain.
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
They're coming back!
Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!
Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --
Um-hmm.
I don't blame you for that.
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
He said his mouth.
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?
Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!
Real courage. That's what we want.
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
Would...would it do any good if I roared?
Come on -- I've got another idea.
Where -- where do we go now?
You humbug!
Dorothy!
Not even a rhinoceros?
Whozat?
Where do we go now?
...Tin Man!
Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
Let's.
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
Hey -- what about Dorothy?
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
Well --
Nuclear.
Zukovsky...
Do you know what youre doing?
Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or well sink.
Weve got to get out.
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It wont just be two weeks out of action.
Old friend?
007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
You havent been given an assignment in this case.
Its a message.  He wants us to know hes back.
The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position..
Who is it?
Who is he?
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially Kings daughter.
I cant stay here.
How did you survive?
...what?
Im coming with you.
Wheres M?
All this, because you fell for Renard?
Valentin Zukovsky.
You, of course. I need some information.
Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rats nest.
Really Bond, couldnt you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!
Wheres the sub going?!
The Maidens Tower.
In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
Any word from him?
What kind of time frame are we talking about?
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
I'm here, Laurie.
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
-- What is it.
Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
They're following us.
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
Welcome back, Night Owl.
What was he doing?
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
What new information?
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
What happened?
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
Nothing wrong with ketchup.
You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
I'm terribly sorry.
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
What about you?
Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
New information.
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
Why is that?
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.
Is that all?
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
Thanks.
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
What do you have?
Whatchu doing here?
Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it "blood week". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.
Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.
Like what?
Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S.
My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
Go to hell!
What are you?
Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?
All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
We can't leave now. We have to do something.
Aren't you afraid?
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself.
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
I can see that. Why?
I'm having fun, what's the problem?
French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
You're serious?
Sit down.
My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.
You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
I had to inspect the merchandise first.
I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!
To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."
You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.
What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.
So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
I wish I could go.
Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
Jean... can you?
I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.
Anything else I can get you?
I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
If necessary.
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
He takes himself seriously.
Where am I?
What are you going to do?
The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility.  To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.
Where are we going?
I've found her, Westchester Mall.
Why?  You have a home here now, if you want it.  Everyone will...
I felt like she almost killed me.
Is it enough?
I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles.
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be.
And who might you be?
What was your grandfather's name?
Where did you get this cauliflower?
No, sir.  It will never happen again.
Yes, sir.
But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.
Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
What?
Darling!...you will be careful!?
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
I will!  Goodbye, darling!
Goodbye, darling.
Love me?
What a strange fellow.
Poor Delbruck!  There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body.
I suppose you're right.
I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.
I suppose you're right.
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
How long will this whole thing take?
What?
One week at the most!?
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?
But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
I see.
Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.
Are these your bags?
Down!  Get down, you beasts!
Did you see anyone else down here?
I want that brain.
You're sure you know what you're doing?
Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
You'll be getting me sad next.
I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.
What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.
How's it going?
Where is he?
I'm a failure.
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
It's alive.  It's -- moving! It's -- breathing!  It's -- standing!  What is your name?
What's that tune that you're playing
Nice!  Nice little balance to it.
Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
Inga, wake up!
Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
Oh, doctor!
Reputation.  Reputation!
Do you think you can sing it?
Did you do it?
Just passing through the night.
It's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
Yes, I know.
MMMMmmmmm!
Are you ready for me?
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
No, not sound.
How do you know they're done?
Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?
Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty.
Yes, sir, name, please?
Do you have a reservation?
Will you hear "Last Post", Sir?
Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
Do not confuse yourse{fi Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?
The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
